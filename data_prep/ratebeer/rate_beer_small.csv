0,"On tap at the Springfield, PA location. Poured a deep and cloudy orange (almost a copper) color with a small sized off white head. Aromas or oranges and all around citric. Tastes of oranges, light caramel and a very light grapefruit finish. I too would not believe the 80+ IBUs - I found this one to have a very light bitterness with a medium sweetness to it. Light lacing left on the glass.

1,"On tap at the John Harvards in Springfield PA.  Pours a ruby red amber with a medium off whie creamy head that left light lacing.  Aroma of orange and various other citrus.  A little light for what I was expecting from this beers aroma...expecting more from the Simcoe.  Flavor of pine, orange, grapefruit and some malt balance.  Very light bitterness for the 80+ IBUs they said this one had.

2,"UPDATED: FEB 19, 2003 Springfield, PA. I've never had the Budvar Cristal but this is exactly what I imagined it to be.  A clean and refreshing, hoppy beer, med bodied with plenty of flavor.  This beer's only downfall is an unpleasant bitterness in the aftertaste.

3,"On tap the Springfield PA location billed as the ""Fancy Lawnmower Light"".  Pours a translucent clear yellow with a small bubbly white head.  Aroma was lightly sweet and malty, really no hop presence.  Flavor was light, grainy, grassy and malty.  Just really light in flavor and aroma overall. Watery.

4,"On tap at the Springfield, PA location. Poured a lighter golden color with a very small, if any head. Aromas and tastes of grain, very lightly fruity with a light grassy finish. Lively yet thin and watery body. Oh yeah, the person seating me told me this was a new one and was a Pale Ale even though the menu he gave me listed it as a lighter beer brewed in the Kolsh style.

5,"Springfield, PA location... Poured an opaque black color with a creamy tan head and nice lacing.  Strong vanilla and roasted malt aroma.  Creamy taste of coffee, chocolate and vanilla. The bartender told me this was an imperial stout at about 8%.  She didn't convince me, there was no alcohol to be found, and it was sweet as hell!  But still good.

6,"On tap at the Springfield, PA location. Listed on the beer menu as ""James Brown Ale"". Had the regular and cask version. Poured a deep brown color with an averaged sized off white head (cask had a huge head). Ill stop on the cask version here as I found it to smell and taste like buttered popcorn. The regular had aromas of nuts, light chocolate, and roast. Taste of chocolate, nuts, very light roast and caramel.	 Tasted on 9/7/2006 and moved over as part of the John Harvard clean up.

8,"Springfield... Poured a hazy copper color with a medium sized, off white head that left spotty lacing on the glass.

Could have been more flavorful.

17,"UPDATED: JUL 7, 2009 On tap. Interesting experiment, but I liked regular Hopula better. Pours a dark amber with an off white head. Aroma is slightly wood and hops, but mostly bourbon.

Just not my style, but would be very interesting if they reused the barrels.

18,"On cask at BI - Aroma of the Hopula Play-Doh hops and malt with lots of oak, vanilla and bourbon.  Pours dark mahogany with a medium lasting head and great lacing.

19,"GTMW 08 on cask - Pours bronze orang with a minimal head.  The aroma has lots of vanilla and some bourbon and toasty malt.  Medium sticky body with light carbonation.

22,"Cask at GTMW.  Poured coppery-amber with a loose cap of beige head.  The aroma picked up an interesting interplay of juicy floral notes, sweet bourbon, and vanilla.. unfortunately interesting in a way that they didnt really go together.. muted the IIPA-ness greatly.  The flavor was on the sweet side with restrained floral and earthy bitterness (likely due to aging).. lots of barrel again with sour bourbon and oak all over.. finished bourbon-ey with even more barrel.  Too sour on the palate, again with too much of the barrel.

On the lighter side in terms of sour intensity, but the overall taste is very pleasant.

36,"Bottle and served in my big old Tripel Karmeliet glass: Deep brown and has a mostly lasting frothy bubbles with spotty lace. The aroma has notes of bakers chocolate, toasty and charred malt, prune and starfruit esters, star anise, floral and herbal hops, a hint of rubber and pipe tobacco. The taste has a Schwarzbier like dry toasty black malt character with a ripened fruity backbone. A bit sugary in midesection and anise spice all over the place. Peaty bite and a hint of sea salt too. The mouth feel is the weak part of the beer, sort of just sits there on the palate offering nothingness. A good beer for what it is but I think I would rather have a New Belgium 1554 first.

41,"Poured into a snifter. Sinister Minister pours an extremely rich mahogany, with a slightly tan head, with a low retention rate, which leads to decent lacing. Aromas are of sweet malts, raisins, candi sugar, spices like cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. Sweet malty taste, spices, fall fruits, molasses. It kind of reminds me of a less carbonated Trois Pistoles.

61,"2007 Bottle Date; Sampled January 2009	An average pour into my 25cl tulip glass leaves me with three-fingers of lightly browned, light tan colored head.  The beer is quite a dark brown, almost black color that shows a brilliantly clear, rich ruby hue to it when held up to the light.  The aroma has a fruitiness to it up front, but then has a meaty malt character to it that is a bit surprising to me.  Aromas of toasted, roasted, almost smoky, dark malt a deep toasted nuttiness (almost like peanut butter).  After a bit the nutty note in the finish seems like it has gone a little rancid.  The aroma on this is not bad, but it is really interesting, I have never quite smelled a beer like this before.		Lightly sweet, again with a fruit note that reminds me of prunes and raisins.  The beer picks up a hint of tartness in the middle that continues to accentuated the fruit flavors.  This beer feels a little light as it first hits the tongue, but it picks up a viscousness as it rolls across the tongue and actually finishes with a fair amount of heft.  That interesting, slightly rancid nuttiness of the aroma is much subdued in the flavor; there is a touch of it here that is almost more of an oral-nasal sense than anything.  Dark malt notes tend to temper that dark fruit notes a bit and also provide a touch of burnt grain bitterness as well as a touch of burnt acidity and perhaps some tannic astringency.  This could use some spiciness to it; it is somehow Belgian-style and some fermentation spiciness would provide a lot more balance to this beer.  As the beer warms up the fruitiness begins to take on a cola like edge.		Other than the fact that the aroma is really starting to annoy me, this isnt a bad beer; I keep on thinking I should be able to exactly identify this note in the aroma, but I cant quite place my finger on it.
",0.65
62,"22 oz. bottle.  Pours brown with garnet highlights and a medium sized beige head.  The aroma has moderate sweetness, yeast, a mix of fruits, and lightly spicy.  The flavor had bready malts, slightly fruity, dusty, yeast, but there seems to be something wrong.  I wasnt sure how old this was, but it appears as if this is in a downward spiral.  Medium bodied.  I should try this again when I know its fresher.

63,"22. 2007. Thanks, Yem! Pours black with a wispy little white head. Big brown bread, roast, and toast nose. Nice! Creamy medium body, very light carb. Toast, roast, and brown bread go round again on the mid-palate, with a mild note of weak coffee crossing the palate at the finish. Solid, stable, well-made little beer.

64,"22oz bottle from StFun. Thanks, Josh. Nice brown pour, with some glinting red in the appearance and a lively carbonation. The nose was rich and very fruity, and this more or less characterizes the taste as well. I was expecting something with more bitterness, and some roasted flavors. This actually comes across far more like a dubbel than anything else, though certainly an enjoyable one. Lively mouthfeel, tasty blend of ripe dark fruits and malts, long finish. Tasty beer.

65,"Black ales and black lagers are elusive specimens, so I am very pleased to partake of a Belgian inspired black ale. Into her dark depths do I prepare to surrender my soul.		her sinisterly seductive liquid fills my glass a dark brown with slight light glinting through along the sides of the glass; a faint amber hue. Not too much head, but an almost immediate brussels lace trail sticks to the sides of my glass. Her nose is lightly sweet with yeast and fresh fall apples. A touch of spice adds to the mix. My first quaff is full of bready chewiness and a smooth, slightly oily body. Faint effervescence prevents Sinister Minister from being too thick and overly cloying, though she definitely has a full body and mouthfeel. a bit more of a sweet and sour twang in the palate as opposed to the nose, leaving an almost lingering sour yeast pucker in the finish. A touch of banana notes alongside the crisp fall apples and spice.		Overall, an intriguing brew. The Belgian style element really changes this black ale from something ordinarily extraordinary into something unusually extraordinary. A bit confused I think as I was left not quite sure the overall impression the Barley Island Sinister Minister Belgian Black Ale was going for, but I do know I enjoyed it. Good; could maybe use a wee bit of fine-tuning, but not much. I would drink it again.

87,"Tasted at Noogfest 4.0 (2008). This Belgian Ale pours a medium black color from a 750ml bottle. Small sized white foamy head. The aroma is roasted malt, yeasty and dark fruit. A medium to light bodied Belgian Ale. The malts are chocolate and toffee. The hops are earthy. Lots of flavors going on here, some roasted malts and some smoke as well. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.

88,"Bottle picked up in South Bend; poured a rich, dark brown with a small to medium off white head.  Aroma of dark fruit, banana, yeast, roasted malt and chocolate.  Was pretty thin and a bit watery.  Flavor reminded me of a black lager, with some spice, nuts and a general earthiness.  Easily drinkable, but it just didnt come together that well.

The aroma of the beer was made up of chocolate, dark fruits, and some earthy, fruity yeast esthers as well.  The flavor of the beer consisted of spicy yeast, chocolate, plums, raisins, and a hint of smoke.  The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with a decent amount of crisp, aggressive carbonation.  Not bad.

97,"From MI2CA, thanks for going through all the effort to find this for me, a trade that was months in the making.  Pours a dark brown, almost black color.   Aroma is what I was hoping for, new and different.  There is an orange/licorice spice coming out, not sure what it is but its but its not overbearing, just there.   Taste is light dark biscuit with light sweet earthiness to it.  Very easy drinking and has none of the typical Belgian yeast dominance. I think its very quaffable with its low bitterness.  Its a nice obscure style and I wish I could try more like this.22oz bomber, Rodenbach smaller tulip glass.

102,"Bottle shared by GMCC2181. Pour was brown to black w/ some reddish hues to it too (when tilted). The head was 1cm and had good retention, steady bubbles rising to the surface. The aroma was coriander spices, oranges, light yeast, some dark fruits. The flavor followed the aroma, nice fruity esters, phenolic spicing, coriander, oranges, mixed dark fruits, and light chocolate and faint smoke/roast in the aftertaste. This sucker had some nice flavors going on, and the only knock was the light (filtered?) mouthfeel combined with seemingly high artificial carbonation. Fix up the latter, and weve got ourselves a very fine beer here - enjoyable as is, though. Thanks, Gabe, for sharing!

104,"22 oz bottle: Pours like coffee, deep black core with dark brown highlights around the rim of the glass.  The head starts healthy, but settles into a skim after a few sips.  The nose really reminds me of a brown ale - notes of toffee, flat caramel and semi-sweet chocolate are abound.  The belgian yeast adds some light, fruity esthers that add an interesting dimension.  The body is chewy with an onslaught of sweet malts.  Notes of caramel and baked brown initially hit the tongue.  The yeast takes on a bigger role here, adding deep fruits, overripe banana, plums and more.  Drinks well and has an interesting complexity.

No it wasnt a flat out assault on the senses, but subtley has its place and it had a place in this beer.		The beer poured out a clear, medium/dark amber color with a 2-finger light tan head.  Aroma was mostly citrusy, slightly vegetative, a bit astringent, with a light toasted malt angle.  Flavor had notes of citrus, a bit iced tea to it, some minor malt sweetness but the thing that suprised me at how dry it was, which really seemed to amplify the hoppage.  Nice beer!

The aroma is dominated by the hops, grapefruit and a sharp floral scent, with some sweet malt seeping through. The mouth feel is thick and fizzy, tickling the tongue. No definitive malt flavor shines through, but its sweetness adds some balance to the citric, earthy hop bitterness that takes over the taste. Nice bitter finish. Pretty good stuff.

152,"12oz bottle poured in a shaker.  I found this bottle in a small liquor store in Granite City, Illinois.  I bought it as part of a pick-n-pack combination.  BIB IPA pours murky orange with large pulp and a medium semi-soapy looking head.  The combination of the pulp and the murkiness is a bit disconcerting if youve never had an unfiltered beer.  Even with experience the darker beer color doesnt look appetizing.  The nose is mostly hop-generated citrus with a very faint malt tone.  The body is oily and surprisingly thick for an IPA but it works well.   The hop bitterness is quite prevalent, pushing most other flavors to the side.  A touch of heather or clover peeks through though.  This beer isnt bad but the bitterness is more reminiscent of an imperial IPA than a straight IPA.  This is probably a local favorite but falls just a little shy when compared to some of the American great IPAs.

153,"12 oz. bottle, courtesy of DrMatt - thanks for this midwest IPA!  Pours hazy medium amber with a small whitish head that leaves spotty lace.

Semi-dry and thin on the palate with plenty of effervescence and a medium body.  Does feature a nice amount of hoppiness, but is a bit thinner and less complex than many others of this style.

174,"I was pleasantly surprised by this.  Pours a murky, dark orange color with a small white head.  Decent lacing.  Floral and piney hops at the forefront of the aroma along with some citrus and malt undertones.  Thin, dry citrus on the initial taste with a big infusion of the hoppy bitterness following.  As this warmed the hops dominated but not in a bad way.  Has a bit of a tart finish.  Good brew.

175,"6/07/2007:  Barley Island Barfly IPA is a ""Tavern Style"" India Pale Ale.  Im not entirely sure what that means, but this was a very drinkable beer that would make a nice session beer...  Barly IPA pours out in a thick looking stream.  It is dark amber and opaque in the glass.  It has a dense, frothy, and lasting beige head that also leaves some lacing.  The aroma is orange, citrus, and sweet pinapple.  The flavor has a smooth, malty backbone balanced by a juicy citrus bitterness.  The bitterness level is fairly substantial, but isnt offensive since it is so well balanced by the hefty, sweet caramel  maltiness.  Not only is the flavor great, but this beer is smooth on the palate and has a nearly creamy texture.  The body is medium to medium-full.  This is a great IPA and really underrated, in my opinion.  	12 oz bottle from The Hop Shop in Indianapolis, Indiana.  Shared with Rob at our weekly/bi-weekly beer tasting.

178,"Bottle.  Caramel malt with a light pepper/pine hops aroma.  Hazy amber with a ton of white particulate matter that remains suspended in the beer like grapes in Jello.  Moderate head.  Slightly sweet caramel/butter malt flavor initially followed by a strong bitter pine hops finish - from the aroma wasnt sure if this was going to have much hops to it but it didnt disappoint.  Strong diacetyl notes for an IPA - very different.

185,"Pours honey orange with a head that quickly reduces to ring around the tulip.  Sugary citrus hop are initially a nice entrance, but they arent nearly well defined enough and become really mushy as the beer warms.

An OK attempt at the style, but in a the sea of fresh IPAs out there, this one sinks.

Poured a hazy orangey copper with a small foamy white head, decent retention, settled into a creamy, sudsy lacing.		Aromas of earthy pine and citrus, mainly grapefruit and orange rind, with a light backing of caramel and biscuits.		Good, even carbonation and a crisp, dry with a little hop roughness in the palate, creamy smooth medium bodied mouthfeel.		Pleasant, enjoyable IPA taste, earthy, resiny, dry hoppiness along with some citric rind bitterness, a light numbing of the tongue, sweet sugary, caramel maltiness, a soft backing to hops, some grain breadiness as well, and a dry sour hoppy and sweet malty finish.		An easy, quaffable drinkability, I thought it had a nice balance, for me personally, a welcome addition to the shelves here in Illinois.

190,"Thanks to Hopdog for this one as part of Mystery Swap #2.  Pours hazy medium copper with luscious 2-finger off-white head.  Aroma of wet hops, tropical fruit (tangerine, grapefruit, honeydew, even cherry and berry notes), heavy black pepper.  Tastes hoppy, with a firm caramel malt base, plus some fruity notes.  It stays a bit sticky and on the sweet side, with more citrus as it warms.  This one is very good.  A tad more complexity and balance would have catapulted this one into the low to mid 4.0 pantheon.

191,"Pour is orange with a white head.  Aroma is a very nice and deep pine hop with a malty backbone.  Flavor loses something.  Still there are decent amount of pine and citrus hops along with some caramel malts.  Still pretty decent as this has a decent hop kick to this one.

192,"These labels are just too busy; I like the information but this is ridiculous. Hazy dark orange pour, looks thick for the style. Somewhat diminishing white head. Aroma is big on salty grapefruit. Also noted are grassy hops, tangelos and dry malts. Smells nice enough, somewhat boring but very unique. Flavor is nice if not uninteresting. More fruit, now more like fruit juice, big orange rind and a little pepper. Finishes off dry. The palate is very nice, carbonation is complimentary. Medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall a very satisfying pale ale.

193,"the nose is maltier than i expected, at least at first; and for an IPA, this is not what i want... but pine resin biscuits are apparently inviting - the flavor mimics, and leaves a dry hoppy taste, not to be without the typical floral and citrus notes. however, it seems too earthy (the maltiness that i seem to want to sense more than the hoppiness) and astringent (the citrus is taken more from rinds than the juicy fruits, if you know what i mean) for me, but i still like it.

207,"2006 bottle from MI2CA drunk on 1/11/07Cant figure out the bottling methods of these guys.  It says unfiltered/unpasteurized on the bottles, though it dosent say bottle conditioned.  The bottle of barrel-aged oatmeal stout was one of the most filtered, watery, loose tasting beers Ive ever had nor did it have any sediment.  This one, howver, has some definite protein dropout, which despite my best efforts got in to my glass, and the very last shot in the bottle (for experimentation) is completely cloudy.  The ruby-auburn-tinged caramel body is light on carbonation, though a fair amount of dark beige head does form, showing medium retention and little/no lacing.Sweet cherries and strawberries in the nose brush against the nose rather coarsely, while leafy, green hop aromatics provide grapefruit and orange rind notes.  Definite crystal maltiness sweetens things to a point, then seems to harden and dry out, with light yeast doughiness and moderate breadiness.  Every subsequent smell, however, is alive with fresh hop aromatics, fruity esters and balanced, sweet malt, it just seems to suffer on the finish, somewhat.  So based on the aroma, I suppose the evidence is in favor of it being unpasteurized at least.  Well have to leave it to the flavor/texture to determine the rest.Bittersweet malt and hops collide, with a strong earthiness and tangy grapefruit flavors that both give way to a ruby red grapefruit sweetness mixed with cherries and moderate herbal notes.  Whatever the medium malt being used, it comes across clearly and quite well.  The caramel-toffee sweetness is well matched and for once some hop acidity is much appreciated in balancing it.  Mostly substantial texture, with moderately engaging carbonation.  Ok, Ill buy that this stuff is lightly to not filtered and just conditioned well.  Not sure on the carbonation, I suspect its forced, but thats ok, Ill let them off the hook for that.  It comes across well enough.

208,"draft - Pours copper colored with a moderate head that leaves some lacing.  Theres a good floral hop aroma.  The flavor features citrus hops supported by some caramel malt.

Bitter and bone-dry, on the resiny side of the hopcoin, yet not really oily.  Grapefruit and citrus, indeed, but light caramel, too.   Aftertaste is a mix of hops and drying darjeeling.  Medium-light body is smooth and very quaffable.  A little too straightforward, but still pretty nice.  This could be divisive, and I on the favoring side.

219,"12 oz. bottle. I get to give this one its ranking among other beers! And in this competitive style, it does hold its own. Big piney hop aroma from the time I pop the cap. Pours a pleasing orangey IPA color, with the carbonation surging into a fluffy head that shortly dissolves to lacing. Pretty clear until you spot the microscopic Bells-type floaties. Taste to my mind is again more of big resiny pine boughs than citrus. But still, its very tasty and filling, and brings out the malts, which appear to be a tad darker in roast than other IPA, a bit more caramel and over-toasted bagel. Its very enjoyable, and distinctive, especially for a bottled IPA. My label says ""Tavern style India Pale Ale."" I have never found a tavern with anything this good.

Slightly hazed orange color with a small, foamy head. Something about the hops/malt balance in this beer reminds me of an American  barleywine though, of course, at a much more moderate level. The malts are more dominant but the hops are strong and cant be ignored. Its sweet w/ melon and pine hop notes along w/ a gentle iced tea astringency.

361,"Thanks to Cavie for sharing this bottle. 		The beer pours a reddish-amber color with a cream-colored head. The aroma is caramel and toffee malt, about what you would expect from a brown ale. The flavor is more of the same, with the addition of some grassy hops which add a slight bit of bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.

362,"Bottle via trade. I think it was drfabulous. Heavy reddish appearance with a bubbly tan head. Aroma is a mix of roasted caramel and musty notes. Flavor is also a musty dry with a watery finish. Ashy flavor with a roasted dry finish.

363,"This is a deep red brown in color. The head is quite large, rocky and of large bubbles. I prefer a head thats a bit more even but this is nice too. Pine hops up front in the nose w/ an woody undercurrent. Hop bitterness is firm but a bit on the soapy side. Really not bad though. The biggest problem this beer has is that its overcarbonated which makes it come across as a bit watery and drowns out any sort of malt depth this might otherwise have. It is very sharp on the tong which detracts from drinkability somewhat as well. There seems like there is a decent beer going on somewhere here but the flaws override most anything enjoyable about it.

Still, I wish there was more going on.

367,"Served from a 12 oz bottle thanks to Craig. The appearance is a really nice ruby brown with a huge foamy light brown head. The aromas are chalky malts, caramel, light hops, brown sugar. The flavors share a bit of that chalkiness, brown sugar, some cereal, little chocolate. Palate is a touch off to me which distracts from the flavors. Overall a solid brown thats not too far off.

Hell, as fine-looking a beer in this style as I know. Smell is mostly brown malts, a bit of Crystal, and this is a new enough bottle that I get some nice grassy fresh hops smell. Taste is lighter than the Newcastle minikeg Ive been draining; a bit more caramel with a hint of coffee. No distractions in this beer travels from my lips to my throat. Just a darn fine brown ale.

Very sweet-smelling, with lots of ripe fruits - some bright enough to be called tropical, and some darker (figs, dates). A bit of apple cider, and some light brown sugar - definitely mostly malts. Hops are barely present. Flavor is equally sweet, but more like caramel or even butterscotch than brown sugar. Watery palate, but what flavor is there is very pleasant.

401,"8/04/2008:  Dirty Helen Tavern Style Brown Ale is brown in color with golden highlights and a thin, speckly veil.  A faint caramelly-molasses-nutty aroma is barely evident.  The flavor is even more elusive which is okay based on what can be found which includes: steeped roasted malt or bark, sour/burnt malt and fruit but sometimes vacantly sweet, and something slightly nutty.  Weird.  Doesnt even quite cut it to be just ""average"".  This beer feels overly thin and watery on the palate and is completely unexciting.  Overall this is a very disappointing beer that misses the mark.  I am quite surprised by how poor this particular beer is considering the quality of several of Barley Islands other offerings, most noteably the Barfly IPA and Majic Java Stout...	12 fl. oz. bottle from tish.  Thanks!  Rating #69 for this beer...
",0.4
402,"Bottle purchased at Corral Liquors in Granite City, IL. Pours a hazy burgundy with a finger of somewhat creamy, beige head that diminishes to a thin cap. The nose is of a somewhat astringent burnt caramel that transitions to an ""off"" phenolic/plastic note; not terribly enticing. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium-bodied and almost creamy-slick, finishing mildly dry and astringent. The flavor follows the nose with an additional roasted nut note. This is a decent brown, but the astringency and plastic note detract from the overall effect. Its not bad, but its not particularly good either.

403,"A good session brown. Slightly hoppy, nutty flavor thats a tad too watery, but fairly standard for a brown. Pours a light brown with a thin head and some good lacing. The malt character of this one actually is pretty good. Nothing too much jumps out about this one.

405,"12 oz. bottle courtesy of a trade with BBB63.  Pours a mostly clear dark brown with a very thin off-white head that had completely vaporized before my first sip.  Pleasnt aroma of lightly roasted malt and some floral hops.  The flavor is similar with light roast up front and moderate hops bitterness at the finish.  The aroma is perhaps a bit sweeter than the actual flavor.  As others have mentioned, not deserving of its low percentile rank - should probably be around 50 percent.

Its ""sweet"", but not very. The bitter tends to balance it out. More like an APA where the malt got a little too intense. It does seem a tad floral, so that may suggest English similarities. Its a damn good drink, and I suggest it is somewhat underrated.

A very different beer from Newcastle and I strongly prefer the former.  Best part of this beer is the color: its a beautiful dark red-brown.  Best paired with cold weather and limited expectations.

459,"Opaque beer with a small tan head.  A little thicker than what I remember of other oat stouts.  A very sharp bitterness/roastedness in taste that leads to a bitter finish.  Faint grassy hops in aroma and taste.

461,"Bottle.  Malty chocolate and roast aroma, touch of air let out of a tire.  Pours opaque black with a soon-gone dark brown head.  Bitter, roasted, and burnt taste.  The stale air continues to plague this one - is it oxidation?  Lasts through the aftertaste.  Potent initial taste, will give it that.  Some oats and acidity, and a light woody note to accompany the mild bitterness.  Medium-light body with an occasional swish of sweetish creaminess.  Touch of hop prickle in the finish.  Needs some work before I award it the seal of approval.

462,"Bottle... Pitch black ale with a tiny, creamy, light brown head; gone in a flash. Chocolaty, coffee nose with touches of light molasses, vanilla bean and oxidation. Semi-sweet chocolate, coffee and caramel flavor. Burnt, moderately bitter notes. Medium-bodied and lightly creamy with soft carbonation. Chocolaty, mildly bitter, dry finish.  Thanks to MIC2A for handing off the bottle prior to our short excursion to Jolly Pumpkin in Dexter, MI

463,"Pours close to black with a brown / orange head.  The aroma has roasted malt with cream.  There are some coffee notes along with bits of char and some vanilla.  Medium body with light carbonation.  The flavor starts with a light citric taste, then comes the char and coffee along with some dark chocolate.  The finish has some spice and then the char slips back in and stay with you.  A decent oatmeal stout - not sure of the age, but this seems like it was a bit aged and would be quite nice fresh.
",0.7
464,"bottle-thanks to vyvvy for the sample.  pours deep brown, almost black with a soapy, big bubble brown head that changes colors depending on the swirl in the glass.  aroma is big fresh roeasted coffee, cigar, char, dusty esters, dark chocolate-really smells tasty!  nice char and dark chocolate flavors.  lightly metallic finish which hinders the flavor profile here.  body is somewhat thin and watery.  this is a fairly good oatmeal stout that would really rock fresh on tap!
",0.7
465,"Bottle and served in my Stone IRS snifter: Pours a deep brown hue that is close to opaque with a fading frothy tan head and the remaining ring left good lace upon the glass. The aroma has notes of chocolate, smoked, nutty malts, oatmeal, prune, coffee, and some grassy hops. The flavor profile is sweet mocha,  toasted grain, walnut, with a light background of acidic fruit and some mild bitterness. The aftertaste does display a bit more hop and coffee bitterness but not much. The mouth feel is medium bodied, slightly oily and carbonated just right matching the flavors. Well not huge or earth shattering, a solid Oatmeal Stout and quite drinkable. Worth another try, could be really good if found on hand pump.
",0.7
466,"Bottle. Pours black with minimal red hues coming out. A small tan head forms and disappears shortly. The aroma is smoky, oaty, and full of very dark mocha and toasted hazelnuts. Nicely roasty in the mouth with thin chocolate and a hint of instant coffee, though some tasty notes of toasted notes hold everything together. This is a pretty good quaff.
",0.7
467,"UPDATED: FEB 4, 2007 draft - Pours black with a big, lingering head and nice lacing.  It has a decent oatmeal and roast malt aroma.  The flavor includes the roast malt and some coffee notes.  Theres very little hops to be found and a light, roasty finish.

468,"Bottle, thanks to NachlamSie. Pours thick and black like tar, with some mahogany only at the extreme edges; brown, slowly-fading head. The aroma has a lot of sweet chocolate, nuts, and some coffee and toffee. Come to think of it, it reminds me a lot of chocolate biscotti. The flavor is very nutty with some roastiness and bitter chocolate. The finish is mellow and toasty. Has a nice oily oat texture. I like it.

469,"Timing is everything. This pours to a deep, opaque balck, with a long thick long lasting tan head and excellent lacing. Aroma is very strongly coffee, toffee and chocolate. Flavor is more of the same.....and malty. Thick body, and rich, warm finish. I drank this on a hot summer day, yet rated it as if I were having it in late fall, on a cool night. A good beer in the right place and time.

470,"Thick, dark, black body with no head.  Metllic, matly aroma -  its not really that great. just OK.  The flavor is surprising filled with bitter cocoa, and roasted malts.

473,"12oz bottle acquired in trade atpayne (thanks!). Opened to a loud Psst. This one poured all head. Eventually settled into a dark black with red edges.

As expected with the pour, the body was on the over carbonated side.

476,"Looked and smelled promising.  Picture perfect stout appearance (though the head deflated rapidly), and the aroma was spot on chocolately coffee.  The palate was watery and not creamy at all.  I would even say slightly gritty.  The taste of the beer left the most to be desired.  It was a shadow of its aroma mostly tasting like burnt coffee with the slightest sweetness and chocolate.  In the end, better than Guiness, but not by much

477,"Dark beer, thin brown head.  Aroma is of chocolate and alcohol, but flavour is bitter, malty, chocolate aftertaste.  Palate is unpleasant.  Not too much flavour, and flavour doesnt match the aroma, nor do they even compliment each other.  not necessarily offensive but not amazing in any way.

483,"Pours inky black with rich but minimal tan head, low carbonation.		Smells of cinnamon, hint of molasses, roasted coffee, cereal grains.		Viscous and chewy on the tongue, though low in carbonation.		Rich roasted chocolate up front, very syrupy with hints of hop presence on the back end.  Not too much different than most oatmeal stouts Ive tried, only richer.  Overall balance is exceptional.		Some may find the rich sweetness to be overbearing over the course of one or two pints, but not this guy.  Leaves a stickiness on the lips and palate, so it may be ruinous to the effect of follow up brews, but its reasonable enough to make a fine nursing beer over the course of an evening.
",0.9
484,"Surprisingly rich and full-flavored after sampling some of their other light/appease-the-masses offerings. Rich malty, roasty aroma. Velvety body thanks to oatmeal, very good balance of malt, roastiness and hop. Nice full body. Keep this one, kick up the Blind Tiger( a quite good, but underdone offering) and scrap everything else on the regular tap. You are in a great location - quit pandering to the masses. Make more beers like this and people will find them on reputation.
",0.8
485,"Poured an opaque black color with a huge tan head that left light lacing on the glass.  Aroma of creamy milk chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts, nuts, and dried fruit in the background.  Taste of roasted coffee, chocolate, faint hoppiness.  Carbonation / gritty mouthfeel, though it was still nice.
",0.75
486,"Pours black with big tan head.  Like the other Barley Island I tried, much too carbonated for the style.  Roasted malt and very light coffee in the aroma, and also a bit medicine-like.  A little bit of coffee in the aroma, but it is carried away with the over-the-top carbonation.  Thin on the palate.  Dont know how long ago bottled.  Either old bottles or poor process control leading to the medicinal aromas and flavors and high carbonations from this brewer.
",0.5
487,"Dark chestnut/garnet body topped by a small tan head.  Pleasant aroma of coffee, vanilla, chocolate, sweet malts.  Medium body with minimal carbonation, but a little on the watery texture.

488,"Dark, frothy and with a touch of sweetness.  Light on the hops, but well orchestrated with the malts. A vanilla bean and light coffee prescence. Smooth on the palate and very drinkable. Id put it on the upper end of ""run of the mill"" stouts.

489,"Deep chestnut brown body, thin light tan head.  Dry chocolate, mocha, and marshmallow aroma, quite toasty.  Sharp chocolate flavor, mocha, and toast with some roasted acidity.  Relatively thin-bodied with a decent flavor profile.  Bitter roasted malt finish.  Wood and even a hint of vanilla peek through the roasted malts; I understand why barrel-aging this beer was so successful.

490,"Bottle pours black as night, large frothy light brown head, with attractive lacing.  Burnt malts, espresso, and cocoa on the nose.  Slight burnt malt, roastiness up front, but surprisingly this one has very little bite.  Fairly smooth mouthfeel, decent body, but the overall flavor is quite light.  Finishes very quick, and with only a sublte hint of roasted malts and hops.  Looks great, tastes good, but lacks any real umph.  Lingering hop bitterness.  Thanks goes out to atpayne for the trade!

491,"Bottle. Poured a small sized tan head with fine-medium sized bubbles that were mostly lasting. Uncarbonated, opaque and a dark brown hue. Malty, burnt, roasted and coffee nose. Coffee, roasted and burnt flavor from start to finish. Smooth palate. Fair lacing.

492,"This bottled brew poured a small head of fine to large sized brown colored mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a good lacing.  The head was notably weird in that it had large sized bubbles on the left side of my mug and finely sized bubbles on the right hand side!  The body was opaque with no visible carbonation and light black in color.  The aroma was very nice with malt molasses and brown beer notes and a mildly vinous coffee scent.  The mouth feel was initially very thick with malty and mild coffee notes and a lingering mild coffee malt bite in the finish.  The flavor was thick with malt and coffee notes.

493,"Opaque black color with a brown head at the pour that is quickly dissipated.  Sweet malt nose as befits the style.  Mouthfeel is full and smooth.  The initial taste is dry, but gives way to a proper sweet aftertaste.  Surprisingly complex, but not deeply so.  Decent effort.

494,"Hometown brewpub, I'd like to see them succeed because Indiana needs lots of help converting the masses away from the commercial swill they are so used to drinking.  Nice deep brown color with a creamy dark tan head.  There was a good smoky aroma that overpowered anything else that may have been present.  The flavor was dominated by a combination of smoky and coffee roasted malts.  It's a decent beer but I've had much better stouts.

495,"From a sampler: This is a beer that I wish I had brought home in a growler. It is also one available in bottles. Pours almost black with a thick tan head an good lacing. The aroma is a pleasant blend of roasted coffee, malt, and chocolate. Very rich and satisfying with a strong cocoa/coffee flavor. Malt, caramel and hops are all in there for good measure too. The finish is long and roasty. This is easily the best beer from the brewpub as far as I am concerned.

501,"12 oz. bottle. $1.60 single @ Binnys. Nice chocolatey smell in the bottle neck. Also in the glass, with no sourness like a regular stout, nor alcohol. Tan colored head atop a opaque black body. Taste is very smooth as befits an oatmeal stout. Dark malts without the bitter ""roastiness."" Malt is thick and sticky on my lip. Again, alcohol in moderation here. Easy to take down with no ill effects.I would wish this had secondary fermentation instead of carbonation for an even smoother texture, but its wonderful just as it is.

502,"Much too decadent of a stout to be clocking in at a mere 4.9%; theres huge chocolate and mocha flavors abound in this bottle.  The hops are kept to a minimum, but the slick texture prevents any unwelcome sugar build-up on the finish.  Plus, the low ABV means you can drink a couple without risking tossing bar stools at the jukebox when ""Take On Me"" comes on.  (2008)

Potently aromatic, mostly syrupy chocolaty sweetness with strong dark fruit undertones and a finishing punch of Boston-style coffee. Low cola notes late.  Palate is off, mildly syrupy yet spritzy and a bit watered-down. Skim milk? Flavor is spot-on with the aroma, Milk chocolate syrup leads to a bittersweet coffee finish. Mostly enjoyable.

Aroma of nice creamy roast, seemingly woody from the oats, some sharp dark chocolate syrupy sweetness, faint touch of butter and molasses.  Flavor follows aroma exactly, woody dry roast, creamy dark chocolate, fairly bitter, seemingly quite dark, still some nice hop presence, off-dry feeling mouth-feel.  Medium bodied, creamy smooth with spread-out sharp fizzy carbonation.  Pretty good.

518,"Ho hum.  I was a bit surprised.  I liked the label and I had just had a Goose Island beer brewed for Trader Joes (the Black Toad Dark Ale)--perhaps the ""Island"" in the name made me think it would be as good, and the upgrade from a brown ale to an oatmeal stout would be an improvement.  But it wasnt much of one.  Rich, thick, for sure, but the flavors were thinner than expected...so malts, not so much roast, moderate coffee.  A little bitterness, a little flavor on the front end....but ho hum among the kingdom of stouts.

At any rate, I found it pleasant and unassuming. The nose is somewhat modest, decent roasted notes and a hint of creamy chocolate. Fizzy body is a bit of a surprise, given the style, and indeed its just a touch too thin for me. Nicely chalky finish, just like the coffee cousin. But the flavor profiles not nearly as complex as Id like it to be, even for a style made to session. Enjoyable even so, and big ups to Josh for giving me a chance to taste this.

A rich, ashy aroma with creamy vanilla.  	The taste is also a bit ashy, bitter, some thin grainy flavor, and thats about it.

554,"12 oz bottle, via Sephiroth.  Pours a clear black body under a fizzy one inch brown head that slowly faded leaving some heavy lacing.  The nose is very chocolaty and roasty with some light chalkiness and coffee.  The flavor is overly roasted to the point where its just too chalky and ashy with some light coffee and milk chocolate on the finish.  I dont get any oatmeal influence at all on either the flavor or body.  Mouthfeel is somewhat thin with a watery texture and moderate soft fizzy carbonation.  Quite a long lingering finish.  Overalll, this was just a ho-hum middle of the road Stout at best.

555,"Bottled.  Poured deep ruddy brown with an explosive cap of deep tan head (Im talkin an inch of liquid and 5.5"" of head!).  The aroma picked up lightly-roasted semi-sweet chocolates, toasted oatmeal, and more charred black malts.. dusty overall with a bit of detergent character that detracted a bit.  The flavor had roasted sweeter chocolates and rolled oats with darker chocolates and coffee more toward the back.. coffee provided light-moderate bitterness, and carries through the short, but enjoyable finish.  Just a tad shy of medium-bodied with a creamy middle on the palate and nice balance.  This grew on me as the drink progressed.

Aroma is mild with a scent of roasted malt.  Color is a deep black.  Taste is dry and toasted.  Starting with a medium body it goes down with a crisp roasted taste coming on and smooth feel.  Finish come is with a bright roasted flavor that turns to a bitter burnt taste and ends with a dry bitterness.  Even looking past the carbonation problem it still just isnt a good Oatmeal Stout.

The taste starts with acidic fruit and moderate bitterness. Light malt background leads to a metallic finish. Balanced true enough but also lacks the hop punch I expected. The mouth feel is sticky and lively, actually pretty refreshing for the size and nature of the beer. By the end I still was left wanting more from this beer but it appears that the keg at the fest is better that some people have had lately.

575,"UPDATED: SEP 23, 2009 Solid all around. Pours a creamy orange, nice thing head, great lacing. Aroma is citrus, slightly metallic, with the ""funk"" that MI2CA mentioned. Flavor is mostly smooth, but with a great bitter bite that adds nicely. Lots of grapefruit in this one actually. Its a great addition to an IPA. The body is nice and thick, never too watery. A great balance of flavors going on too, nice malty notes with delicious citrus fruits dancing around. Not as strong as a Dreadnaught or 90min, but this has a lot of character to make up for it.

Texture is rich and creamy, but the bourbon is just too much.

579,"Cask at the brewery - I must first mention that I am not a fan of the non-raspberry version of this beer.  The aroma is initially roasted dark malts with raspberry notes that quickly fades into oak and bourbon.   Pours black with a brown ring head and good lacing.  Flavor is strong bourbon, roasted dark malts and chocolate with a hint of raspberry.  Cask provides a smooth and creamy finish.  Overall I think the bourbon is still too much and overpowers the subtleties of the raspberry and base brew.  But better than the non-raspberry.

Watery, with light bourbon and pale/amber, resolves to a bland bitterish/pale ale taste, forgettable and really without the best elements of the style, which no amount of aging in a Jack Daniels whiskey barrel will change.  In defense of the brewer, this may be an older sample; at the same time, if its being served on location, then there are quality control problems to be addressed (and possibly tap lines to be cleaned).

622,"On cask at GTMW.  Poured black with a spotty cap of dark tan head.  The aroma was sweeter and toasty with lots of chocolate and dry brandy-like accents.. enticing.  The flavor found semi-sweet chocolate and toasted caramel at the core with a restrained, yet complementary barrel treatment.. sweet, roasty finish with chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon.  Lighter carbonation on the palate with a dry barrel impression.. felt good, and quite satisfying on the finish.  Nice one!Earlier Rating: 8/5/2007 Total Score: 3.8Bottle thanks to Mike, I believe.  Poured a clear, deeper brown with a cool swirly dusting of deep beige head and what appeared to be legs running down the sides of the glass.  The aroma definitely focused on the barrel aspect, with sweet vanilla, bourbon, and lightly-charred oak representin... although none of these characteristics were abrasive, and the underlying stout was quite nice with medium-roasted chocolate and mild lactic notes.  The flavor had nice roasty chocolate again at the core with some sweet oats.. barrel accent was very well executed with vanilla bean and bourbon accents.. finish was somewhat long, beginning with roasted bakers chocolate and transitioning to sweet bourbon, oak char, and mild lactic sourness.  About medium-bodied on the palate with higher carbonation (a touch too high.. filling up the mouth too rapidly).  All in all a very good beer!

623,"UPDATED: JUL 27, 2009 12/06/2007 and 8/13/2008:  Barley Islands Bourbon Barrel-Aged Oatmeal Stout Tavern Style Ale has a good aroma of vanilla, roasted malts, hints of licorice, and some dark fruits and smoke.  The color of the beer is nearly black and is has a small frothy tan-colored head.  The flavor is really smooth and mellow as the vanilla, roasted and caramelized malts, chocolate, and slightly dry bourbon and charred wood mend together.  This beer has a medium to medium-full body and is quite smooth with a bit of a creamy texture.  This particular bottle is much better than the first one I had.  That one was really bland and unexciting.  This one really has some barrel aged aromas and flavors as the vanilla and some slight bourbon notes are definitely noticeable.  This beer isnt stellar, but it is still quite tasty for being a barrel-aged oatmeal stout.  It is really well-balanced and although it might not be high in alcohol, it is still a good deal at only $4.49+tax per bomber!  This is a solid sessionable barrel-aged oatmeal stout (first one?) at that price and probably the cheapest ""barrel-aged"" beer available!	22 fl. oz. bottles from Westside Wine and Liquors in West Harrison, Ohio.  Rating #115 for this beer...

627,"Courtesy of CigarCityBrew. Pours deep darkness with nice looking mocha head. Handsome beer. The aroma has barrel wood notes, sweet bourbon and mild chocolate to go along with roasty notes and faint oxidation in the background. Delicious flavor with creamy mouthfeel ushering in sweet mildly roasted malts, rich chocolate and wood notes. I get a mildly building bourbon sensation and an oatmeal twang in the back. It seems to thin out just a bit into the finish. Tasty.

630,"22 oz. Bomber: Pours a coffee black with a dark medium tan head that diminishes to the side of my glass rather quickly. This brew lives up to its name since the bourbon comes out in the aroma and flavor. Sweet aroma also has hints of oatmeal, dark chocolate, and dried fruit. Bourbon flavor finishes with a mild dry bitterness. Just like drinking bourbon straight, this is a good sipping pastime. This is one of the better bourbon stouts that I have had. Well Done!

634,"22oz bottle, courtesy of a trade from a while ago.  Thanks!  Pours a very dark chocolate brown color; huge, textured, medium tan head with great retention and fine-bubbled, glistening lacing; a beautiful pour.  Smells like lightly toasted oak, vanilla extract, and lots of slightly warming bourbon in the aroma; the sweet vanilla can seem a bit much, and the bourbon comes on strong at first.  Medium mouthfeel: loads of warming bourbon, milk chocolate, and toasty oak and vanilla; the bourbon and oakiness is a bit beyond the chocolatey, light stout underneath; but theres really nothing overly harsh or astringent here, surprisingly; a warming, reasonably tasty milk chocolate stout.  Medium finish, toasty oak, vanilla, soft bourbon and wood, with plenty of chocolate.

635,"I couldnt tell a big difference between the regular and the oaked aged brew.  The oak age perhaps is a little more robust with and smooth with the flavor.  It is a solid oatmeal stout, but has a certain spice on the after taste.  Barely Island Java Stout is a lot better.

The body offers a more rounded chocolate and marshmellow notes.  The finish ends boozy as well.  This is a fresh batch to be released in bombers in November.  Il have to grab a fresh bottle to lay down for a while because this could really sing with some age on it.

645,"Expected more from this.  Poured nearly opaque black with an ample frothy brown head.  Slight note of vanilla, wisp of bourbon, touch of oak.  Nothing intense.  Very subtle.  Stouts should not be subtle.  Especially bourbon barrel-aged ones.  Also, too much carbonation and too light in the body.  The flavor was weak notes of bourbon, coffee, chocolate.  Disappointing.

646,"Served on cask at brewpub. Pours a very dark black with a minimal dark tan head. Aroma is bourbon and coffee. Very strong bourbon aroma. Taste is like a Kentucky Breakfast Stout with a lot more coffee and a lot more bourbon. No subtelty here. Tasted more like a hard alcohol drink than a beer. ABV must be extraordinary. Not very drinkable due to huge ABV. If you love coffee and bourbon, this one is for you, but it certainly isnt for the feint of heart.

647,"22 oz bottle, vis nolankowal.  Pours a deep black colored body under a one inch brown head that gained density as it sat, ending in a tight bubbled foamy cream.  Aroma is very roasty with just the lightest accents of vanilla and bourbon.  Some chocolate fudgecake, and a little chalk.  The flavor is pretty thin with a mix of chalky roast, vanilla extract, and a light lactic tinge.  Very, very, light barrel influence.  Mouthfeel is on the thinner side with an almost nitrogenated carbonation feel to it.  A little bit of sweet stickiness on the finish.  Overall, just a little bit too thin all around, and lacking in complexity.

648,"Bottle (650ml) shared at Biegamans Summer Gathering -- my bottle courtesy of lewis13. Pours black with ruby hues and an average size somewhat-lasting light-brown head. Aroma of bourbon (but thankfully not too much) along with chocolate, some roastness, oats and oak. The bourbons even more subtle in the flavour which is nice (thats how it should be!) along with sweet malt, chocolate, oak, some hops and a mild bitter finish. Medium bodied. This is bourbon barrel-aged done right, its not overpowering. I really enjoyed it.

649,"22oz. Bottle	$4.99	Big Red Bloomington		Poured the darkest brown body you could imagine. So close to black its hard to tell the difference. A 1+ finger chocolate head formed on the pour that quickly faded to a whispy cap with thick edges. Leaves sticky thin drink lines with each sip that slowly fall back into the body. This beer looks good but menecing at the same time.		The aroma starts off with a solid base of malt. Coffee beans and bittersweet chocolate are both present and very enjoyable. A perfect blend of vanilla bean, some musty wood, and mild bourbon come in flashes over the malts. This is a wonderful warm smelling beer.		The flavor is all in the aroma. The chocolate maltiness starts things off and is quickly followed by coffee beans at mid-palate. The coffee beans follow through to the finish and are accompanied by lightly roasted grains. The vanilla and mild bourbon leave a very pleasant coating that lasts a few seconds after the swallow. Leaves a mildly bitter coffee aftertaste.		Medium body with a nice creaminess from the barrel aging. Sluggish carbonation lets the beer work through at its own pace. 		This is definately a highly drinkable beer. Very enjoyable and not heavy like most of the barrel aged stouts you run into. Lower abv lets you enjoy a few glasses without being too much.		This beer is a huge surprise. I saw the average score before I reviewed and after sampling this bottle I really cant understand why its so low. This is a wonderful beer. If its retired I hope they plan to bring it back at some point. Really well made beer.		Notes: I read through some other reviews after I wrote this one. Many said the bourbon was way too strong. I sat on this bottle for probably 4-5 months.		3/3/07

650,"Pours black with a fair tan head that stays well. Aromas of oak, slight bourbon, some chocolate, and a little vanilla.  Flavor is oak, bourbon, chocolate, roasted malts, and some vanilla.

Lots of dark malts with a black liquorice and chocolaty flavour, then some kind of oak juice join in providing a nice sourness taste and all that is followed by some limy hops leaving the taste-buds a pleasant tartness.  I very much liked this beer, a lot more so than anybody here it seems.  Noblesvilles noble beer.
",0.85
653,"My Bottom Line:	This competent sweet stout is strongly influenced by its vanilla-laced bourbon, yet it never exaggerates as its barrel-aging and malty molasses sharply dip into drying roastiness. 		Further Personal Perceptions:	-The fast-depleting head is barely noticed if you are staring into the deep darkness.	-The carbonation is rather frothy for the style, nearly recalling Belgian-style effervescence.	-Licorice and dark chocolate appear within the bourbon-made vanilla.		Bottle; no date.

655,"22ozer from Khans on Keystone. Pours a clear brown with  abit of tan foamy head. Nose is dominated by the barrel aging giving it a one-sided aroma. It was nice tho as there were some underlying notes of toffee and chocolate just not upfront and personal.

656,"Bomber shared with muenster and NachlamSie. Pours black with amber extremities and a big tan head. The aroma is coffee, raisins, whisky, and hints of alcohol, caramel, and toffee. The flavor is dominated by interesting coffee notes, with some distant bitter chocolate. Some smoky bourbon notes come out once in a while, but not too often (as seems to frequently be the case with barrel aged stuff). The aftertaste is quite warm. Grainy oat flavor is apparent at times, too, though not as smoothly as other oatmeal stouts. Pretty good in all.
",0.8
657,"Bottle split with Muenster, Tronraner. A nice dark chocolate-colored pour into our glasses reveals a very heady brew. The aroma obviously has bourbon and a chocolate nut bar. The oats are very much noticed. In the mouth bourbon is easily noticed, but it doesnt overwhelm or interrupt the other flavors of the stout. Rather, it melds well with the chocolate/coffee flavors not to mention the dense toasted oats. The finish reminds me of a Girl Scout Samoa cookie, just imagine it not being sweet. This makes a great sipper with a medium-heavy palate and very assertive flavors.

658,"Bomber, thanks NachlamSie. Pours dark black/brown/ruby with a massive dark tan head. The aroma was very nice, strong on the bourbon, with notes of coffee, and chocolate.

663,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2006 22 oz bottle - Pours very dark brown with a big, enduring head.  It has a heavy bourbon aroma.  The flavor is dry roasted malts and quite a bit of bourbon.  Theres a moderate body with okay carbonation.  The finish is unremarkable.  It loses something overall.  I thought the bourbon dominated too much, not because there was too much bourbon necessarily, but rather because there wasnt enough else going on.  Its alright, but drinking my way through the whole bomber I got tired of it.

664,"Bottle: Dark brown to black pour, monster head. It took quite a while to fit this 22oz into a liter mug. Aroma smelled a little too much like sawdust and cheap booze.

665,"Bottle shared by IMtheOptimator.  Pretty ample light brown head with a thick brown body.  Aroma of frash grains and some brown sugar and molasses.  First impression is this is over-carbonated.  It leaves me feeling like Im drinking foam, not liquid, so its hard to even get to the flavor.  After a few minutes the flavors start to come out.  That graininess sticks around from the aroma, in both the palate and the flavor.  The brown sugar is there as well, coming along with a distinct bourbon note at times.  Coffee.  Tasty, but not my fav.

666,"Bottle shared by IMtheOptimator.  Sweet, chocolate and coffee aroma with some vinousness and a bit of bourbon in the background.  Mostly opaque dark dark brown color with a HUGE tan head.  Very carbonated, bubbly and roasted coffee flavors to start with some sweet sugary notes to follow.  The bourbon makes some mild cameo appearances in the background.  This has just the right amount of barrel flavor.  This beer is too carbonated, though.

The aroma is pretty nice, with HUGE bourbon, backed up by ashy roast and coffee.  The flavor is all right, but WAY too big on bourbon.  That dominates the flavor, and a dry and ashy espressoish stout hides behind it.  Medium-bodied with a rather dry mouthfeel, and a bit boozy for 6%, from all the bourbon I guess.  Overall, a bit unbalanced.  If they were able to fine-tune the -bal aging though, I could see this being pretty good.

Medium-bodied, with a roasty mouthfeel and medium carbonation.  Lingering finish of deep, bitter roast and with some ash as well.

The flavors are grainy with oatmeal and rye forward and whiskey in the after taste. The oak flavors have a rawness to them and dirty tone (not negatives) and a spice. Some wet coffee grinds too. The mouth is medium to full bodied with a tighter fizzier carbonation. I got to say this one grew on my quite nicely. A touch mellow but raw and tasty.

681,"Thanks to Oakes for sharing this bottle.  Thick brown head over a pitch black beer.  Sweet chocolate/vanilla aroma with some definite oaty type of aroma.  Flavour seems a bit hot (especially considering its only 4.9%).  Lots of oakiness but with less vanilla than woodiness.  Woody complexity in the flavour but comes across with a bit of astringency as well.  Slightly overcarbonated as well.  Not bad, but definitely not great.

683,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2007 22 oz bomber.  Being a Buffalo Trace bourbon fan, I was looking forward to trying this one.  The nose is all bourbon, almost like you have a shot of bourbon in your hand.

684,"Bottle - a fairly strong bourbon aroma what gives way gradually to some chocolate as it warms.  Black body with a huge near medium-brown head.  It really is overcarbonated.  It took 4 series of pouring and waiting for the head to subside to get 3/4s of a glass.  The flavor is kind of odd.  Some swallows the bourbon is up front and others it is in the finish.  I dont know that Ive experienced that before.  There is some chocolate in there, as well.  Fairly thin for the style and lacking the creaminess that is typical for an Oatmeal Stout.  Interesting as most bourbon-aged beers are.  Another rater said that it is too small for the bourbon and that may be true.  Hopefully theyll stick with it and tweak it.  Shows promise.

687,"I had a nighmare about this stuff. I wanted to have no mention of it ever again, but I needed to just vent. Pours clear dark brown and foamy. Nose is all bourbon, maybe some vanilla, oak. Taste is bourbon, astringent. No malts, watery and thin. Cola like carbonation. Drain pour. Cant take a mediocre beer and make it better in a barrel.

688,"2005 bottle shared with SuIIy on 11/23/05.  The bottle says it is unfiltered and unpasteurized, but yet, the beer pours the most fizzy, clear thing I have seen lately.  If this isnt forced carbonation, than its the strangest natural carbonation Ive ever experienced.  Deep cola brown, somewhat dull, not much in the auburn-red tinged department, as some deeper colored stouts have.  Tan-beige head is mountainous and very very slow to recede.  Lacing present.  Aroma of straight bourbon, dry and lightly alcoholic, with light vanilla and very dry wood.  Hints of bakers chocolate, some light yeast and very little else.  No sweet malt, no creamy oat-like notes, no hops.  Flavor is full bourbon.  Hints of peanut skins, salt, seltzer water and alcohol.  Pure bourbon, dry wood and light roast.  Its not that the bourbon is overdone here, its just that the beer is underdone.  No malt sugars, little if any chocolate or roast.  Body seems very filtered, though they say it is not.  Carbonation is omnipresent, sharp, obtrusive and very high.  Texture is watery, loose, prickly and thin on end.  As it warms, the aroma takes on a note of glue or hot plastic.

689,"22oz bottle from ATPayne. First off, I would love to try this side by side with a non BA version. Since I cant, I will simply give a description of this version. Pours a nice black color with a foamy brown head. Seems very fizzy and carbonated. Nose is mainly bourbon with a slight bit of chocolate seeping through. Flavor is all bourbon, a little bit woody and some more bourbon. Lacking here, nothing good happening and the bourbon has taken this beer hostage. No solid stout characteristics remain and its like drinking a carbonated glass of watered down bourbon. BA is not always successful.

690,"Bottle.  Medium dark brown opaque pour.    Weak bourbon aroma, with some alcohol and maybe a woody/earthy hint.  Medium roasty malt flavors, with bourbon and chocolate.  Way too carbonated and not at all oatmeal-stout-creamy.  A little thin too.
",0.65
691,"Poured black with a huge tan head.  Aroma of roasted malt with the bourbon running underneath.  As opposed to the porter which had the bourbon on top.  Flavor of roasted malt with a touch of bourbon.  Smooth mouth feel but not as creamy as I thought it would be for an oatmeal stout.
",0.65
692,"Totally opaque pour with a massive, long lasting tan head - aroma of bourbon, vanilla, oak, alcohol - a bit thin on the palate - not many oatmeal stout characteristics besides a hint of lactose - mostly, the wood and bourbon from the barrel overpower whatever other flavors the beer has - if you want a similar experience, soak a tongue depressor in whiskey and suck on it.

693,"Something must have been wrong with this bottle!!!  Large head that quickly fades to nothing over a black body.  Thick and oily.  Cocoa, caramel and malty nose, quite mild.  Flavor is biting:  bitter, like unsweetened cocoa and very difficult to enjoy.  Sour finish and my mouth is left feeling dry.  No complexities or unique flavors.  It tastes very much like finished wood.

694,"Atpayn is the rater that sent me this set of Barrel Aged Brews!  		 Ink black body with the most ridiculously oversized tan head (like Freds brother) that my have ever been seen by man or beast! I think. Well I know I let this beer cellar for too long by the secondary fermentation that took place in the bottle, hence the massive head (Freds brother) I have this problem with Shipyards Bluefin Stout. Its unfiltered, and once the beer warms to about 70F it starts a secondary and becomes over carbonated. 	 Nevertheless, the aging must have toned down the bourbon presence; although it is still dominate. The flavor has rounded very nicely. Massive notes of toasted oak, vanilla, hazelnut, chocolate, coffee, and bourbon duhhhh! Downside the palate is feeble; thin and lacking punch.  If it were more full bodied this beer would rock the block, no doubt.  A great effort overall!

695,"Bottle served in a Expedition glassware:	Pours a deep brown hue with ruby highlights around the edges topped by a frothy tan head and good lace. The aroma has notes of mocha, oats, caramel,  smoke, dusty yeast, floral hops, and a hint of bourbon esters. The taste starts malty sweet with noticeable oat and chocolate overtones before leading towards a vanilla and oaky midesection. The finish is bitter mostly from dark malts and sublime hopping. The feel is quite lively and aggressive, a tad overcarbonated and thin. Needs more oatmeal for body. Overall, I liked it but could see how others may be disappointed. The barrel aging is upfront and the feel is weak. With some tweeking, this beer could rock. I have only the one bottle but would pick up another or two for a rerate and trade if I can find it.

696,"black, off white head.  toasty toffee-ish bourbon aroma with some chocolate.  flavour is sweet and boozy, but the body seems thin for the style and the barrel aging.  finishes roasty and mildly tart.

697,"The bourbon aromas were obvious and dynamic. Sweet chocolate and roastiness too - very nice aroma. Standard stout appearance leads to a slightly overpowering whisky flavoured beer. It finished fairly smoothly but I found it too thin and unbalanced to score high.

698,"Bottle at Fall Beerfest In Toronto 2004.  Near black in colour.  Aroma of bourbon, some chocolate roast, alcohol.  Flavour of bourbon, sugary sweet, light roast, some toffee, a little buttery.  Lightish body, medium carbonation.  Finishes smooth, medium length.  Not too bad

701,"Rich dark appearance with a huge frothy chocolaty head. Mild aroma of sweet malts and lightly hoppy. Flavor is quite sweet, rather chocolaty with strong carmel tones, very thick, somewhat chalky, and a little bit sour, that detracts from it. Decent but far from great.

703,"Big thanks to TAR for this one!  22 oz bomber acquired in a trade!  Impressive lasting chocolate brown head on a dark chocolate brown body.  First whiff is watered down whiskey/bourbon.  Beyond that its chocolate, light roasty malt with a very, very subdued raisiny dark fruit character.  Toasted oatmeal when it warms along with oak woody notes and hints of vanilla.  Very smooth complex aroma IMHO!  Well balanced flavor with roasty & vanilla flavor; Chocolate & caramel  with resiny hop. Whiskey in the finish & aftertaste, but more subtle than the aroma.  finish is on the malty sweet side.  Minimal fruitiness.  Medium high carbonation...way too much for the type of beer that this is.  A little dry in the mouth, very thin, probably due to over carbonation.  A little thin in the mouth, but overall I think a very fine beer!  Great nose, above average palate, but the body killed the overall experience for me.

704,"Black with a ruby tinge, and a dark tan head. Big aroma of bourbon and malt with some roasty edges. Thin body and poorly balanced flavour, like a weak stout topped with a shot of sweet whiskey. A real let-down, especially after it smelled so good...  [Toronto Christmas Party 04]
",0.5
705,"Quite a long name. Poured deep and dark black, brown head. Whiskey aroma along with some sweeter malts and a bit of roast. Dominant bourbon flavor, roast is an afterthought. Medium bodied. It wasnt that bad but I think the barrel aging would have fared better with a bigger beer.

706,"UPDATED: JUN 7, 2007 Bottle (650ml) shared at Biegamans Summer Gathering courtesy of blankboy.  Black, small bubbly tan head.  Sweet bourbon alcohol aroma.  Nice taste - dry oatmeal, bourbon - nice mix, not overpowering.  Oak, chocolate as well, agreed with blankboy, this one achieves a nice balance.  Compared to the very small sample I had two and half years ago - I really enjoyed it!				Original rating:  small sample at Dougs Dec 04! 6/4/4/2/11 Bottle @ Dougs.  Strong whiskey aroma, pitch black body.  Big tan head.  Good solid stout body and mouthfeel, but I did not like the mix of whiskey and beer flavours together - completely unbalanced.  Seems like a novelty act to me, not really enjoyable in the end.  Big thanks to those who brought it though, I appreciate the chance to try it.

709,"Thanks to whoever brought this to the Toronto Christmas Party 04.  Smells like Jack Daniels.  Very alcoholic/astringent nose.  Strongly bitter but with some milky coffee.  The flavors imparted by the barrel is overwhelming.

710,"Pitch black body with a chocolate coloured head. Strongly alcoholic aroma  with notes of sweet dark fruit and bourbon. Flavour is highly alcoholic covering up the vauge notes of malt and chocolate underneath. Rough, and fairly thin bodied. Disappointing for my first barrel aged beer but am very glad I got to try it. Many thanks to Wohlfs and Qdog for bringing this to the Toronto Christmas Party 2004.

711,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2008 Bottle acquired in trade with Atpayne (thanks Adam). Slick black color and a light brown head. Taste is of mellow oak, vanilla, milk chocolate and roasted malts. Oatmeal is hardly noticeable. Mouthfeel is smooth and almost full bodied. Bourbon flavor is more in the finish along with mellow bitterness. A freakin well done beer.

712,"Sweet vanilla porter.  Bitter and sour.  Slightly creamy flavors -- melted ice cream.  Tasted like too much vanilla extract -- fake, overly sweet, and artificial.
",0.55
713,"Has some over carbonation issues with the pour, but settles down to a nice opaque black with a rich dark tan head.  Has a pleasant subtle dry roasty malt aroma with plenty of bourbon character to back it up.  Starts with a light sweetness and caramel maltiness with some hints of dark chocolate, vanilla and coffee toward the finish.  Could use some more body, but has nice bourbon complexity and flavor throughout.  Pretty dry for a sweet stout though.  Many thanks to atpayne for this brew!
