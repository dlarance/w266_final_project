1333,However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town.,1
1334,The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre.,1
1335,You can't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown.,1
1336,"They're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing, Queens.",1
1337,Baluchi's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices.,5
1338,The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent.,1
1339,He offers subpar service and has no personality.,1
1340,"In fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment.",1

1369,"The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol",1

1386,I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna.,5
1387,"Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.",5
1388,"I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)!",5

1393,We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.,5
1394,"Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, Sea Bass and Crispy Duck.",5
