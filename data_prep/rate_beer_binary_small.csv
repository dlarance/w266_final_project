0,"On tap at the Springfield, PA location. Poured a deep and cloudy orange (almost a copper) color with a small sized off white head. Aromas or oranges and all around citric. Tastes of oranges, light caramel and a very light grapefruit finish. I too would not believe the 80+ IBUs - I found this one to have a very light bitterness with a medium sweetness to it. Light lacing left on the glass.

1,"On tap at the John Harvards in Springfield PA.  Pours a ruby red amber with a medium off whie creamy head that left light lacing.  Aroma of orange and various other citrus.  A little light for what I was expecting from this beers aroma...expecting more from the Simcoe.  Flavor of pine, orange, grapefruit and some malt balance.  Very light bitterness for the 80+ IBUs they said this one had.

2,"UPDATED: FEB 19, 2003 Springfield, PA. I've never had the Budvar Cristal but this is exactly what I imagined it to be.  A clean and refreshing, hoppy beer, med bodied with plenty of flavor.  This beer's only downfall is an unpleasant bitterness in the aftertaste.

3,"On tap the Springfield PA location billed as the ""Fancy Lawnmower Light"".  Pours a translucent clear yellow with a small bubbly white head.  Aroma was lightly sweet and malty, really no hop presence.  Flavor was light, grainy, grassy and malty.  Just really light in flavor and aroma overall. Watery.

4,"On tap at the Springfield, PA location. Poured a lighter golden color with a very small, if any head. Aromas and tastes of grain, very lightly fruity with a light grassy finish. Lively yet thin and watery body. Oh yeah, the person seating me told me this was a new one and was a Pale Ale even though the menu he gave me listed it as a lighter beer brewed in the Kolsh style.

5,"Springfield, PA location... Poured an opaque black color with a creamy tan head and nice lacing.  Strong vanilla and roasted malt aroma.  Creamy taste of coffee, chocolate and vanilla. The bartender told me this was an imperial stout at about 8%.  She didn't convince me, there was no alcohol to be found, and it was sweet as hell!  But still good.

6,"On tap at the Springfield, PA location. Listed on the beer menu as ""James Brown Ale"". Had the regular and cask version. Poured a deep brown color with an averaged sized off white head (cask had a huge head). Ill stop on the cask version here as I found it to smell and taste like buttered popcorn. The regular had aromas of nuts, light chocolate, and roast. Taste of chocolate, nuts, very light roast and caramel.	 Tasted on 9/7/2006 and moved over as part of the John Harvard clean up.

7,"Sampled @ the Springfield, PA location.   Candi Sugar dominates this Belgian Ale.  Beer was on the flat side but had a nice crimson color.   Enjoyable Belgian Ale, I did not expect John Harvards to have it in its line-up.

8,"Springfield... Poured a hazy copper color with a medium sized, off white head that left spotty lacing on the glass.  Aroma of yeast, dried fruits, clove, banana, and cherries, with light roastiness.  Aroma was very dubbelish.  Herbal taste of dark fruits, yeast and alcohol was barely noticed.  Slick mouthfeel.  Could have been more flavorful.

9,"UPDATED: FEB 19, 2003 Springfield, PA. Darkish copper colored, with no head -	probably poured like that on purpose.	Served inappropriately at about 40 deg	F.  This beer was cold.  It tasted	fine at that temp but I had to let it warm up 	for awhile.  It was worth the wait, as a	very interesting and complex character developed.	Very phenolic and funky - with a strong ester of	bubblegum.  Also a little clove or some kind of 	spice.  Strong but not overwhelming at all.  Surpisingly	easy to drink.

11,"UPDATED: FEB 19, 2003 Springfield, PA. Interesting example.  The fruit flavors are very apparent, but the natural mildness of the currants keep the sweetness in check.  These flavors blend well with the white beer base.

12,"From Springfield PA:  nice smooth	malty flavor, mildy fruity, but served	via nitro and thru a restrictor disc	(stout tap).  Thus, overly creamy and lacking	some of its original flavor.  I could tell there	was a pretty good beer in there.  Aroma difficult	to detect.

13,"On tap at Springfield location.  Pours a translucent golden amber with really no head.  Aroma of caramel, grains and light hops.  Flavor was malty with a light hop presence.  Really kind of non-descript overall.

15,"Handbottled from trade wth Sprinkle. Pours a nice dark copper color with medium size off white head. Aroma of bourbon, malt , hops and oak. Slight smokey flavor with a bourbon taste in the initial sip. Flavors of malt, vanilla and hops still remain although none dominate the brew. Taste is still very enjoyable with a smooth and balanced finish.
",5
16,"On tap at the Great Taste of the Midwest (8/9/08): Pours a transparent bright copper orange with an airy white head.  Aroma of sweet toasty pale malt and sweet light fruitiness with a good resiny piny hop character.  Body starts with decent fullness and sweet caramel malts with good balance of hop flavor and bitterness.  Finishes smooth and bittersweet, nicely aged and balanced.
",5
17,"UPDATED: JUL 7, 2009 On tap. Interesting experiment, but I liked regular Hopula better. Pours a dark amber with an off white head. Aroma is slightly wood and hops, but mostly bourbon. Flavor is everything I loved about Hopula, but with too much booze. Some nice vanilla notes, but bourbon constantly overpowers the Hopula. Just not my style, but would be very interesting if they reused the barrels.
",5
18,"On cask at BI - Aroma of the Hopula Play-Doh hops and malt with lots of oak, vanilla and bourbon.  Pours dark mahogany with a medium lasting head and great lacing.  Flavor is strong bourbon, too strong.  The base beer is hidden under there somewhere but is way overpowered.  I had trouble getting it down to be honest.
",1
19,"GTMW 08 on cask - Pours bronze orang with a minimal head.  The aroma has lots of vanilla and some bourbon and toasty malt.  Medium sticky body with light carbonation.  The flavor starts with the aroma traits with more caramel malt and earthy hops.  The finish has vanilla and okay dominating everything.  This kind of beer is just not down my alley.

22,"Cask at GTMW.  Poured coppery-amber with a loose cap of beige head.  The aroma picked up an interesting interplay of juicy floral notes, sweet bourbon, and vanilla.. unfortunately interesting in a way that they didnt really go together.. muted the IIPA-ness greatly.  The flavor was on the sweet side with restrained floral and earthy bitterness (likely due to aging).. lots of barrel again with sour bourbon and oak all over.. finished bourbon-ey with even more barrel.  Too sour on the palate, again with too much of the barrel.

32,"On tap at Noblesville brewery - Aroma is pungent with lots of brett and oak.  Flavor brings forward some toasted malts but quickly falls back to doughy yeast, oak and brett giving it a nice funky sour finish.  Palate is tart and creamy.  A fantastic sour that would draw some attention if it got out of the brewery.

33,"I was surprised by this one. A really nice local sour beer. Pours a great looking brown with a slight red hue. Not much head, but a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nutty, with cherries and a tartness to it. Very earthy. Flavor is nice and sour, lots of red fruits and nuts, with just a hint of yeast. The wood really comes into play here, and works nicely with the other elements. This one is tasty for sure.
",5
34,"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2009 Pours murky brown with a small brown head. Good bretty nost with some dusty malt. Brett and some oak take the flavor to a really wonder full place. Medium full body with a dry finish. Really a super unexpected treat.

35,"Had this on tap last night at new Barley Island, broad ripple location. Pours medium brown with light tan head that fades. Nose is sweet brown malt and slightly sour brett. Taste is smooth, clean brown style malt with a perfectly balanced sour profile bringing in the brett flavor. I was skeptical of the at first, but it came out quite nicely IMHO. On the lighter side in terms of sour intensity, but the overall taste is very pleasant.
",5
36,"Bottle and served in my big old Tripel Karmeliet glass: Deep brown and has a mostly lasting frothy bubbles with spotty lace. The aroma has notes of bakers chocolate, toasty and charred malt, prune and starfruit esters, star anise, floral and herbal hops, a hint of rubber and pipe tobacco. The taste has a Schwarzbier like dry toasty black malt character with a ripened fruity backbone. A bit sugary in midesection and anise spice all over the place. Peaty bite and a hint of sea salt too. The mouth feel is the weak part of the beer, sort of just sits there on the palate offering nothingness. A good beer for what it is but I think I would rather have a New Belgium 1554 first.
",5
37,"This pours a clear chestnut body with a slender beige ring in place of a head.  No lacing.  The aroma is lightly roasted malt, faint floral scents, dark brown sugar, and licorice.  All remain in the flavor, which is a bit thin, the body being somewhat watery, with the addition of a soft dark fruitiness.  The aftertaste is one of licorice, not overbearing and annoying, but subtle.  Not bad.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp? Liquors, Porter, IN<font size=-1>

38,"22 oz bottle pours a dark chestnut body with a one inch khaki head. Aroma is subtle, with perfumey florals, anise, and a sweet maltiness. Medium body supports some dark roasty notes, candy sugar, anise, dark fruits, and floral hops. Nicely complex and a good sipper.

39,"Pints from BI at release party - This is going to be BIs entry for the ProAm category at GABF - Aroma is yeasty bubblegum and dark malts with a floral hint.  Pours very dark brown with a medium head and good lacing.  Flavor is roasted dark malts, bubblegum yeast, candi sugar and a touch of hops.  Palate is clean and a little sticky.  Hides alcohol well and is overall an easy drinking tasty brew.  Soon to be released in 22oz bottles.

40,"A nice, malty ale with a definite Belgian quality to it, this one had an almost black appearance, lightly sweet nose, and a fairly light (medium at most) mouthfeel.  Not too heavy, and good with the bar food.

41,"Poured into a snifter. Sinister Minister pours an extremely rich mahogany, with a slightly tan head, with a low retention rate, which leads to decent lacing. Aromas are of sweet malts, raisins, candi sugar, spices like cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. Sweet malty taste, spices, fall fruits, molasses. It kind of reminds me of a less carbonated Trois Pistoles. Crisp, clean and smooth mouthfeel. Not as carbonated which is nice. Very good drinkability. This is the first pro-am I have had, and it is a great one to start with.

61,"2007 Bottle Date; Sampled January 2009	An average pour into my 25cl tulip glass leaves me with three-fingers of lightly browned, light tan colored head.  The beer is quite a dark brown, almost black color that shows a brilliantly clear, rich ruby hue to it when held up to the light.  The aroma has a fruitiness to it up front, but then has a meaty malt character to it that is a bit surprising to me.  Aromas of toasted, roasted, almost smoky, dark malt a deep toasted nuttiness (almost like peanut butter).  After a bit the nutty note in the finish seems like it has gone a little rancid.  The aroma on this is not bad, but it is really interesting, I have never quite smelled a beer like this before.		Lightly sweet, again with a fruit note that reminds me of prunes and raisins.  The beer picks up a hint of tartness in the middle that continues to accentuated the fruit flavors.  This beer feels a little light as it first hits the tongue, but it picks up a viscousness as it rolls across the tongue and actually finishes with a fair amount of heft.  That interesting, slightly rancid nuttiness of the aroma is much subdued in the flavor; there is a touch of it here that is almost more of an oral-nasal sense than anything.  Dark malt notes tend to temper that dark fruit notes a bit and also provide a touch of burnt grain bitterness as well as a touch of burnt acidity and perhaps some tannic astringency.  This could use some spiciness to it; it is somehow Belgian-style and some fermentation spiciness would provide a lot more balance to this beer.  As the beer warms up the fruitiness begins to take on a cola like edge.		Other than the fact that the aroma is really starting to annoy me, this isnt a bad beer; I keep on thinking I should be able to exactly identify this note in the aroma, but I cant quite place my finger on it.
",1
62,"22 oz. bottle.  Pours brown with garnet highlights and a medium sized beige head.  The aroma has moderate sweetness, yeast, a mix of fruits, and lightly spicy.  The flavor had bready malts, slightly fruity, dusty, yeast, but there seems to be something wrong.  I wasnt sure how old this was, but it appears as if this is in a downward spiral.  Medium bodied.  I should try this again when I know its fresher.
",1
63,"22. 2007. Thanks, Yem! Pours black with a wispy little white head. Big brown bread, roast, and toast nose. Nice! Creamy medium body, very light carb. Toast, roast, and brown bread go round again on the mid-palate, with a mild note of weak coffee crossing the palate at the finish. Solid, stable, well-made little beer.
",5
64,"22oz bottle from StFun. Thanks, Josh. Nice brown pour, with some glinting red in the appearance and a lively carbonation. The nose was rich and very fruity, and this more or less characterizes the taste as well. I was expecting something with more bitterness, and some roasted flavors. This actually comes across far more like a dubbel than anything else, though certainly an enjoyable one. Lively mouthfeel, tasty blend of ripe dark fruits and malts, long finish. Tasty beer.

65,"Black ales and black lagers are elusive specimens, so I am very pleased to partake of a Belgian inspired black ale. Into her dark depths do I prepare to surrender my soul.		her sinisterly seductive liquid fills my glass a dark brown with slight light glinting through along the sides of the glass; a faint amber hue. Not too much head, but an almost immediate brussels lace trail sticks to the sides of my glass. Her nose is lightly sweet with yeast and fresh fall apples. A touch of spice adds to the mix. My first quaff is full of bready chewiness and a smooth, slightly oily body. Faint effervescence prevents Sinister Minister from being too thick and overly cloying, though she definitely has a full body and mouthfeel. a bit more of a sweet and sour twang in the palate as opposed to the nose, leaving an almost lingering sour yeast pucker in the finish. A touch of banana notes alongside the crisp fall apples and spice.		Overall, an intriguing brew. The Belgian style element really changes this black ale from something ordinarily extraordinary into something unusually extraordinary. A bit confused I think as I was left not quite sure the overall impression the Barley Island Sinister Minister Belgian Black Ale was going for, but I do know I enjoyed it. Good; could maybe use a wee bit of fine-tuning, but not much. I would drink it again.

78,"Bomber from Crown.  Herbal nose with heather and some tire air.  Pours the deep brown of a porter, with a short light brown head.  Taste is dry and roasty but still has those herbal notes (which endure into the aftertaste, where they approach juniper and give a slightly chalky residue) and flashes of fruity sweetness.  Dark chocolate, loads of anise, licorice, but very little of the latter.  Body is watery and a bit foamy, slightly tangy but without acidity.  Refreshing and dangerously easy to drink!  Smooth and subtle, a good bridge between new and old, one of the more interesting finds of this year!

90,"A fairly good Belgian. Full of flavor, whether it be from the hops (theres a lot of them) or from the malts ( this runs high). Its a decent Belgian.

91,"Poured from a 22oz bottle and served in a tulip.  This beer poured an almost black with some mahogany highlights and a one-finger thick head of tan foam that quickly faded into a thin cap.  The aroma of the beer was made up of chocolate, dark fruits, and some earthy, fruity yeast esthers as well.  The flavor of the beer consisted of spicy yeast, chocolate, plums, raisins, and a hint of smoke.  The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with a decent amount of crisp, aggressive carbonation.  Not bad.

92,"Pours black with a fine white head. Aroma is rather sweet and yeasty. Moderate mouth feel with spicy, chocolate and caramel notes. Decent beer.

93,"22 oz. bomber: Pours a dark brown/almost black cola color with a fizzy carbonated head that diminishes in the blink of an eye. Roasted aroma has hints of liquorice, and dark fruits. Flavor his sweet and spicy that tingles the thin mouthfeel. I did find it very refreshing and good. I was just disappointed with the appearance since it literally looked like I was drinking a flat Coke or Pepsi with no ice in my pint glass.

94,"Very nice.  There should be a category for black ales.  Pours black with minimal rapidly dissipating head.  Taste is sharp with notes of roasted malt, earthy notes and floral hops.  Very good ale and would make for a frequent drink.

95,"Poured a clear dark red-brown color with an off-white head.  Chalky roasted malt with some phenoles, ash and hops all thrown in.  Very light roasted sweet malt.  Hint of chocolate.  Light-medium body.

96,"Bottle.Small tan head that mostly diminished, spotty lacing, transparent, carbonation observed, and a brown hue with a red tint. The nose was malty, roasty, licorice, lightly spicy, dark fruits, and some roastiness. The flavor was malty, lightyly roasty, lightly spicy,some dark fruits, and some smokiness towards the end.Tingly mouthfeel and medium in body.Quaffable, easy to drink and an interesting beer to rate.Worthy of a try.

97,"From MI2CA, thanks for going through all the effort to find this for me, a trade that was months in the making.  Pours a dark brown, almost black color.   Aroma is what I was hoping for, new and different.  There is an orange/licorice spice coming out, not sure what it is but its but its not overbearing, just there.   Taste is light dark biscuit with light sweet earthiness to it.  Very easy drinking and has none of the typical Belgian yeast dominance. I think its very quaffable with its low bitterness.  Its a nice obscure style and I wish I could try more like this.22oz bomber, Rodenbach smaller tulip glass.

98,"UPDATED: JUN 7, 2008 2007 bottle shared by beastiefan2k.  Deep brown beer, thin fast fading head.  Aroma is lightly licoricey with a light plumminess and a soft grapey vineousness.  Lean dark malts, but not a lot of roast.  Lightly spicy with a little bit of apple sweetness.  Pretty decent brew. 	7 3 7 3 14	Bottle shared by eyedrinkale.  Brownish black with a light brown head.  Sweet and slightly toasty aroam.  A bit of light corianderish spiciness and some sweet nutty/chocolatey malts.  Lightly spicy and yeasty with a bit of molasses on the back.  Chewy and a bit of lightly leathery flavour as well.  Quite a tasty brew.

99,"Shared, thanks to beastiefan2k.  Brown pour with reddish hint.  The aroma has some dark fruit, sweet malt, and candy sugar.  The flavor starts with lightly roasted malt, with sugar and floral / earthy spices.  Interesting beer.
",5
100,"Thanks to beastiefan2k for sharing - cloudy dark red beer, with a moderate lacing - aroma of dark fruit, chocolate, spices, some oxidation - there a bit of oxidation in the flavor, too, along with hard to place spices, but the flavor seems focused around this earthy, vegetal quality that I couldnt quite get into - a wee bit of nutty character - the spices become quite warming in the finish - a little thin, but an interesting beer.
",1
101,"Thanks STFUN for this one. Color was black with a red tint. Smelled of dark fruits and spices. Taste is toffee, small amount of chocolate, and fruits spices. Texture is light, not watery though, with some carbonation.  Like josh said almost a wine beer. Different but good. Thanks again josh.

102,"Bottle shared by GMCC2181. Pour was brown to black w/ some reddish hues to it too (when tilted). The head was 1cm and had good retention, steady bubbles rising to the surface. The aroma was coriander spices, oranges, light yeast, some dark fruits. The flavor followed the aroma, nice fruity esters, phenolic spicing, coriander, oranges, mixed dark fruits, and light chocolate and faint smoke/roast in the aftertaste. This sucker had some nice flavors going on, and the only knock was the light (filtered?) mouthfeel combined with seemingly high artificial carbonation. Fix up the latter, and weve got ourselves a very fine beer here - enjoyable as is, though. Thanks, Gabe, for sharing!

103,"Bottle courtesy of stfun.  Pours dark brown with a dissipating white head.  Smells of tea, some caramel, hints of nuttiness.  Tastes of chocolate, some spice, molasses, fruity hints, earthy.  Interesting.
",5
104,"22 oz bottle: Pours like coffee, deep black core with dark brown highlights around the rim of the glass.  The head starts healthy, but settles into a skim after a few sips.  The nose really reminds me of a brown ale - notes of toffee, flat caramel and semi-sweet chocolate are abound.  The belgian yeast adds some light, fruity esthers that add an interesting dimension.  The body is chewy with an onslaught of sweet malts.  Notes of caramel and baked brown initially hit the tongue.  The yeast takes on a bigger role here, adding deep fruits, overripe banana, plums and more.  Drinks well and has an interesting complexity.
",5
105,"Pours near black with ruby hues and a mostly receding tan foamy head. Taste is toffee, light chocolate, phenolic fruits, cherries, and spice. Mouthfeel is medium to full with lush carbonation. I dont know why this is considered a traditional ale, its pretty much a Belgian-style stout, except for the serious shortage of yeast character.
",1
106,"bomber thanks to immy.....pours deep dark brown with frothy yet thin off-white head.....aroma mostly made up of dark fruits, some banana, and other sweet malts.  dont notice too much chocolate or roast....flavors of sweet malt, a little caramel with some dark fruit and pepper accents. carbonation is lively and mouthfeel was a little thin.

107,"22 ounce bottle.  Pours mostly black with some ruby highlights when held to light.  Slim off white head.  I smell floral hops, berries, bubble gum,  and some banana.  Pretty much taste the same thing.  A little bit of clove flavor as well.  Medium body.  High carbonation.  Dry finish.  Just an okay beer.
",5
108,"Bottle:  Pours a dark ruby-tinted amber with no head.  Roasted malt, sweet bread dough and some subtle chocolate notes in the nose.  Dry, bread dough flavor which ended up being much sweeter than expected.  Has a nice belgian yeast taste to it.  Not much in the way of body on this but still drinkable.

113,"Had nearly 10 of their beers and this was by far my least favorite. A golden pour with nearly no head. Aroma and flavor is extremely light. This beer was very ordinary. Light pale ale qualities.

114,"Another quality session IPA.  The lowest ABV of any IPA I would buy for regular consumption.  Tasty..but could be improved upon a little bit.  A brand new batch was just made. Im with the guy who thinks Chinook...I love the grapefruit taste in this beer.  Mad Anthony India Pale Ale is 100% Chinook so that might explain why I like Barley quite well.  Ill ask Mike at Barley and report back with reviews on their full line.

115,"Received in a trade with mmm///beer, so thanks bro.  The beer was quite nice actually, with enough hops to satisfy this West Coast hop head.  No it wasnt a flat out assault on the senses, but subtley has its place and it had a place in this beer.		The beer poured out a clear, medium/dark amber color with a 2-finger light tan head.  Aroma was mostly citrusy, slightly vegetative, a bit astringent, with a light toasted malt angle.  Flavor had notes of citrus, a bit iced tea to it, some minor malt sweetness but the thing that suprised me at how dry it was, which really seemed to amplify the hoppage.  Nice beer!

116,"bottle thanks to mmm///beer.  deep ruby color with a 1 finger cream head.  great hoppy, citrusy and slight spicy scent.  good thickness and a mild hop flavor that isnt bitter.

117,"on tap-pours a light tan head that laces and amber color.  Aroma is northwest hops-grapefruit.  Taste is sweet northwest hops-grapefruit/slight bitter, some medium malt.  	*@Indiana Beerfest-on cask-pours a white ring for a head and hazy gold color.  Aroma is pine-hops (Chinook?), some medium malt.  Taste is resin/pine-hops (Chinook?), some medium malt.  Minimum carbonation.
",5
118,"Bottle via trade with mmm///beer.  This brew pours a thick, hazy orange with a continual slow bubbling and a modest light head. The aroma is dominated by the hops, grapefruit and a sharp floral scent, with some sweet malt seeping through. The mouth feel is thick and fizzy, tickling the tongue. No definitive malt flavor shines through, but its sweetness adds some balance to the citric, earthy hop bitterness that takes over the taste. Nice bitter finish. Pretty good stuff.
",1
119,"Pours a transparent bright copper orange with a spotty-lacing off-white head.  Aroma of sweet toasty caramel malts with a touch of resiny, piny hops.  Starts with good fullness and sweet crystal maltiness with a decent balance of piny bittering and flavor hops.  Finishes with nice residual sweetness and a crisp bitterness.  Certainly more on the maltier side of IPAs, but I like it.
",5
120,"Pretty malty for an IPA. Lingering bitter taste and dry mouth follow. Maybe a beer trying to hard? Settles oddly in your belly.
",5
121,"12 oz. poured into shaker (purchased at Liquor Barn- Louisville, KY)- poured transparent orange/amber color, small off white head formed and quietly bubbled away with some lacing, low carbonation.  Aroma of floral hops, citrus, and malt.  Hits the mouth with a low-medium body, malt comes in at first but quickly transforms into hops that strike the back on the tongue.  Finish has a tendency to drop off, sharply.  Its welcome in my fridge anytime.
",5
122,"Pint at the brewpub.  Dark copper with heavy hops on the nose.  Nice hop bite in the flavor with a fairly short clean finish.  Decent I.P.A.  	P.S. One of my favorite movies!

123,"bottle.  decent IPA.  good hop flavor...not overly strong but pretty smooth.  Id call this average overall

124,"On tap at the brewpub.  I think this was being served from the beer engine.  Pour was dark amber with a good off white head.  The aroma and flavor are both very strong with citrus hops.  The flavor was even kind of gooey.  Medium body with an appropriate amount of carbonation.  Dry finish.  Really a nice beer.
",5
125,"12 oz. bottle.  Pours a slightly hazy dark amber color with a dense beige head.  The aroma is orange citrus, moderately sweet caramel malt, and a touch of pineapple.  The flavor has a good bit of caramel malt to balance the citrusy hop bitterness.  This one shows good balance and judging by the scores is a little underappreciated IMHO.  Smooth and easy to drink with a medium/full body.  A very solid IPA.
",5
126,"(bottle) copper with nice head. Citrus/floral aroma. Flavor is citrus/floral hops with caramel malt.
",1
127,"12oz bottle. Lots of malt, quite possibly lots of caramel malts because it comes off as overly sweet even with the large amount of resiny hops. The hop bitterness is there, but the flavor and aroma contribution seems minimal. Big mouthfeel, lots of carbonation. Not the way I like my IPAs.
",1
128,"12 oz bottle into shaker.  The aroma is dominated by floral and citrus hops while the flavor is mostly dominated by grapefruit hops.  It is smooth and sweet with just the right bite.  Medium bodied on the palate.  Overall: Not much to say here except that this beer is underrated and delicious IMO.
",5
129,"Bottle purchased at Corral Liquors, in Granite City, IL. Pours a cloudy copper with two fingers of frothy, ecru head that laces well. The aroma is a slightly musky blend of floral, citric and lightly earthy hops over pale malt. On the light side of medium-bodied, the palate is slightly grainy with a bitter, resinous hop finish. Toasted malt with a solid hit of floral and faint citric hops, it finishes dry and bitter. This is a decent brew, but its certainly not among my favorite IPAs.
",1
130,"Bottle,  Heavy hoppy aroma and taste.  Grapefruit and orange peel flavors shine through.  Decent frothy off white head with decent lacing.  Huge floaties with a medium amber color.

134,"I typically dont enjoy IPAs, however, this flavor was not a bitter as most IPAs. It smells and looks good. Not as strong as Id expect, but a good smell. The flavor was delicious, however, it clearly is not the flavor of an IPA. I really dont enjoy how it stays on my tounge, it feels coated with bitterness. I was impressed with this beer from the standpoint that it tastes, smells, and looks good. However, it is not quite correct for an IPA. Also, it doesnt sit on my palate well. Overall, a very good beginners IPA.

135,"Bottle courtesy of Indybigtom: Poured a cloudy orangey color ale with a nice foamy head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of bitter dry hops is dominating with some light caramel malt.

136,"12 oz bottle from acknud; thanks!!! Nose of lemony hops, light malt, and a background fruitiness; cloudy orange with a big straw head, heavily lacing the glass; flavor has moderate hop bitterness, with a light caramel malt background and some light lemony bitterness for a finish!

137,"Clear light copper color with a tall lasting ecru head. Pale malt with earthy hops undertones. Some citric hops in the background with a sweeter tint, oranges and rudy red grapefruit. The scents seem a bit thin with no real depth. Lots of citrus flavors with tang and just a hint of butterscotch. Finish is lightly sharp with some pine tar and biting citric pith.LInger has a touch of malt and caramel to help smooth things out. I find this closer to an APA.

139,"Bottle.  Tinny orange in the nose, fruity, herbal, minty even.  Taste is somewhat clean pils malt but has a vegetal staleness, and hop charachter is mild: mint leaves, navel oranges, lemon, floral flavors, a little bit astringent and sharp at times.  Decent overall.

140,"Pours dark orangish amber with a mostly receding wispy tan head. Aroma of citrus, grapefruit. Taste is citrus, bready, crackery malt, toasted grains, grapefruit. Full bodied, resinous with lush carbonation. Pretty enjoyable IPA, not aggressively bitter.

141,"Pretty good offering from Barley Island. Not the best IPA Ive ever had, but its different from most of the average ones, which is good. Pours a really nice amber color, with a perfect head. Lots of carbination bubbles. Very piney aroma and flavor, nice balance of citrus, and a little malt mixed in. Bitterness on the back end, with a metallic aftertaste (which I didnt care for). A little too sticky, but a good local brew.

Nice fluffy white head that stuck around.  Grassy hop flavor.   Not overally bitter like most American IPAs are. There was an off aftertaste.  I could not put my finger on it.  I would call this an APA not IPA.

Odd taste - burnt malt, some hops, sweetened tea.  Man, I did not like this one at all. Maybe it was off, but the bottle was fresh enough from one of Harrys recent trades I think.

150,"Bottle (12oz).  Shared with tupalev, my bottle.  Hazy amber, average frothy off-white head.  Interesting aroma, initially sweet nutmeat or cocoa -then leafy, UK-style hops.

",1
151,"Bottle purchased at Corral in Granite City, IL. This poured with lots of floaters in the medium amber colored body. A light khaki head was on top. The aroma was basic oranges and bread crust. The taste was some grapefruit and a little bread crust. A nice woody finish. A decent IPA.
",5
152,"12oz bottle poured in a shaker.  I found this bottle in a small liquor store in Granite City, Illinois.  I bought it as part of a pick-n-pack combination.  BIB IPA pours murky orange with large pulp and a medium semi-soapy looking head.  The combination of the pulp and the murkiness is a bit disconcerting if youve never had an unfiltered beer.  Even with experience the darker beer color doesnt look appetizing.  The nose is mostly hop-generated citrus with a very faint malt tone.  The body is oily and surprisingly thick for an IPA but it works well.   The hop bitterness is quite prevalent, pushing most other flavors to the side.  A touch of heather or clover peeks through though.  This beer isnt bad but the bitterness is more reminiscent of an imperial IPA than a straight IPA.  This is probably a local favorite but falls just a little shy when compared to some of the American great IPAs.
",5
153,"12 oz. bottle, courtesy of DrMatt - thanks for this midwest IPA!  Pours hazy medium amber with a small whitish head that leaves spotty lace.  Mild aroma primarily of toasty malts and floral hop notes with a hint of orange.  Flavor comes across more strongly, toasty malts again, hints of caramel provide a counterpoint to the floral, piney and grapefruit rind hoppiness, finishing with astringent spicy tingle.  Medium to full body and prickly carbonation.  Quite enjoyable.

154,"Didnt care for the first one, but the drinkablity was actually quite high.  Good quality brew.  A little on the malty side.

155,"Poured a nice orange/copper color with nice head and lacing.  Aromas were average, really had to sniff hard to get all of them.  Tasted pretty well balanced, with a nice malt profile mixed with a decent hop presence.  The intensity wasnt really there, as it lacked the punch I like.  It was drinkable.

156,"Poured an orange amber color with a small white head.  The aroma and flavor have mostly citrus hops but some earthy ones as well.  Caramel malt controls the hops.  Light to medium bodied.

159,"Bottled.  Poured hazy medium orange with lots of chunky sediment and a short, well-retained cap of off-white head.. nice lacing as it descended.  The aroma picked up orange and other citrusy hoppage along with floral notes and some biscuity malts.. more-or-less malt-based and intriguing with the combination of elements.  The flavor had a sweet, tacky caramel base that was rum (or more accurately some other raw booze) accented.. mild to moderate bitterness of the citrus variety.. pine notes on the finish.. a bit rough all-around.  Medium-bodied and too sharp at several points on the palate.. could have perhaps used more hoppage to help the balance.

162,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a shaker.  This beer poured a dark brownish copper color with a foamy beige head that slowly faded.  Some uneven, sticky lace was left around the glass.  The aroma consisted of a big citrus/grapefruit presence followed up by a nice caramel malt backbone.  The flavor was super hoppy, with sweet grapefruit flavors giving way to the roasted caramel, and finishing just slightly bitter.  The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with minimal carbonation.  This is an excellent brew, done in the same vein as Alpha King.  Very tasty, and vastly underappreciated.

163,"Pours a beautiful orange amber with a one inch off-white head. Aroma is a great balance of floral/herbal, citrus hops with a touch of caramal malt. Not as strong as it could be. Flavor is surprisingly balanced--great floral front hop (slight grapefruit--not too much), a complex nutty, caramel malt background, followed by a moderate bittering finish.  Not too bitter; not too sweet. Mouthfeel, for this size beer, is has a pleasant unexpected stickyness. I concur with many that this makes a great session IPA in an age of big beers.

164,"Bottle courtesy of lewis13. Pours a cloudy orange-amber with a kajillion tiny little floaties and an average size off-white head. Aroma has a nice balance of citrus and pine hops and sweet malt. Simple flavour of hops and caramel malt, a bit of fruit and a quick bitter finish -- easy to drink and refreshing. Medium bodied. Good stuff.
",5
165,"Hazy copper pour with foamy off-white head. The beer looks thick and feels thick and has a decent balance between bittering hops and sweet malts. Citrus aromas of grapefruit with notes of pine and flowers. Some caramel in the background. The flavor is moderately bitter and lightly sweet. Thick mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Finish is bitter. A bit too full-bodied for my taste in an IPA, but certainly ejoyable enough nonetheless.
",5
166,"Nice IPA I got from my Secret Santa. Thanks man! Aroma was kind of weak but what was there was all hops. Pour was a beautiful dark burnt orange with a nice 1 finger off white head. Taste was mostly citrus hops with a little malt in the background, but this is definately a hops oriented IPA. Not too strong or overbearing however, just a good sessionable IPA which is rare nowadays.
",5
167,"Bottled sample via mnurda. Orange in colour with a bit of haze and some floaties. Average carbonation. Aromas of citrusy hops and roasted malt. A bit of vanilla sweet malt in the mouth, with the grapefruit-orange hop elements showing up mid-sip. Theres a nice black pepper bitterness on the back finish, which sharpens up the mouthfeel nicely. Could use a bit more hop presence on the nose, but a pretty good IPA otherwise.
",5
168,"Pour is amber orange with a somewhat thick head for the style.  Aroma is vegetal, herbs, and some grapefruit hops.  Flavor is more on the malty side with some bitterness in the finish.  Not the smoothest IPA, but then again, most IPAs arent supposed to be smooth.  Very average within its class, which makes sense given its style pct.   Kind of an interesting side note.  My wife picked a 6 pack of this up thinking my friend liked IPAs.  I told her that one of the few styles my buddy didnt care for were IPAs (which meant score more for me).  Yey!

169,"12oz. bottle.  Predominantly citric, fruity hop aroma, some faint lemon and grapefruit detected along with touches of doughy yeast and toasty malt sweetness.  Hazy light-medium amber color, full of particulates, with a very fine but lasting head. Flavor profile follows the aroma rather closely, primarily showcasing the hop presence, which makes itself known here in the form of a light acidity and increasing bitterness, alongside the juicy citrus, leafy herbal qualities and faint, grainy malt sweetness.  Semi-dry and thin on the palate with plenty of effervescence and a medium body.  Does feature a nice amount of hoppiness, but is a bit thinner and less complex than many others of this style.
",1
170,"Pours to a hazy copper body with tons of large particulate and a tall lasting slick off-white head.  The flavor is full of toasty bread, interesting specialty malts, bitter herbal grassy hops.  Overall, pretty decent.  The flavor is toasted specialty malts and light herbal hops.  Quite toasty but also, that makes it more APA-ish.  The palate is bitter and medium bodied with a nice malty texture.  Very drinkable, but not overly superb.

171,"Dark amber color with clinging and long-lasting off-white head; lots of sediment in my glass too.  Lots of pine, some orange (not so much grapefruit to me); decent aroma.  The flavor is more ambiguous, with a lot of malt backbone, but giving it a mix of vegetation, beer-stained carpet, and smokers breath.  Moderate astringency, long-lasting bitterness, not to my preferences.  Decent carbonation and body support.  Halfway through my glass I ate a slice of watermelon--note to self: IPA and watermelon do not mix.

172,"12 oz bottle.  Pours a clear bright copper body under a fizzy off white head.  Minimal to no visible carbonation, and lots of sticky lacing.  The aroma hops are very leafy and earthy smelling with a slight tea like quality.  Minimal malt impact.  The flavor is very earthy and quite bitter with a moderate toasted malt base.  Nice lingering bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a moderate fizzy carbonation level.  A pretty nice drinkable IPA.

174,"I was pleasantly surprised by this.  Pours a murky, dark orange color with a small white head.  Decent lacing.  Floral and piney hops at the forefront of the aroma along with some citrus and malt undertones.  Thin, dry citrus on the initial taste with a big infusion of the hoppy bitterness following.  As this warmed the hops dominated but not in a bad way.  Has a bit of a tart finish.  Good brew.

175,"6/07/2007:  Barley Island Barfly IPA is a ""Tavern Style"" India Pale Ale.  Im not entirely sure what that means, but this was a very drinkable beer that would make a nice session beer...  Barly IPA pours out in a thick looking stream.  It is dark amber and opaque in the glass.  It has a dense, frothy, and lasting beige head that also leaves some lacing.  The aroma is orange, citrus, and sweet pinapple.  The flavor has a smooth, malty backbone balanced by a juicy citrus bitterness.  The bitterness level is fairly substantial, but isnt offensive since it is so well balanced by the hefty, sweet caramel  maltiness.  Not only is the flavor great, but this beer is smooth on the palate and has a nearly creamy texture.  The body is medium to medium-full.  This is a great IPA and really underrated, in my opinion.  	12 oz bottle from The Hop Shop in Indianapolis, Indiana.  Shared with Rob at our weekly/bi-weekly beer tasting.

177,"Excellent off white head on this dark orange beer (Though I suspect this is more of an artifact of the Kwak glass I using).  Too much sediment floating  around the body.  Floral hop nose with some vegetable properties.  Bitter hop body a hint of biscuit from the malt.

178,"Bottle.  Caramel malt with a light pepper/pine hops aroma.  Hazy amber with a ton of white particulate matter that remains suspended in the beer like grapes in Jello.  Moderate head.  Slightly sweet caramel/butter malt flavor initially followed by a strong bitter pine hops finish - from the aroma wasnt sure if this was going to have much hops to it but it didnt disappoint.  Strong diacetyl notes for an IPA - very different.

179,"Super fruity, caramel and hop aroma.  Woody, hoppy, English cast.  Some butte, pretty bitter.  FInish is a bit clingy.  Bottle, McNivens, Indianapolis.

180,"12oz bottle pours dark amber with a short offwhite head.  Aromas of grapefruit, slight pine and lots of floral notes.  Flavor is pretty well balanced with some pineapple notes over bready malts.  Slight spice and lots of bitterness at the finish.  Medium bodied with good balance.

181,"Bottle: Pours a hazy copper color with an off white head. Aroma, citrus, floral, and some spicy hops, bready pale malts. Flavor, caramel, some spice, a bit bready, with a slight bitterness.

182,"Fruity, spices, and pleasant hops aroma.  Clear copper.  Grapefruit bitterness, which is mildly off-set by sweet malts, but bitternss lingers.

183,"Pours a typical American IPA color.  This thing has tons of floaters.  Might be clear if not for the floaters.  Decent white head with some lacing.  I cant place the smell but is somewhat chemical.  Tart hoppy flavor.  Not much body.  Some bitterness.  Almost no malt flavor.  This is really average.
",1
184,"Medium brown in color with a nice foamy off-white head this is a nice looking beer.  Aroma is typically very hoppy and tart.  The hops give a sharp bite to the flavor and leave some bitterness.  Some citrus but not a lot.  It is a pretty good IPA and is consistent throughout.  Too bad this is not a favored style of mine.
",1
185,"Pours honey orange with a head that quickly reduces to ring around the tulip.  Sugary citrus hop are initially a nice entrance, but they arent nearly well defined enough and become really mushy as the beer warms.  The earthy yeast also becomes more apparent, as well as the husky malt.  The hops become real resinous and bitter in the finish.  An OK attempt at the style, but in a the sea of fresh IPAs out there, this one sinks.

186,"Poured dark honey/orangey.  Aroma was floral.  Taste was pine and floral hops, not as much citrus as I expected.  Not one of my favorite IPAs.

189,"From a 12 oz. bottle with no freshness date, short blurb on the label, sampled after a few hours in the refrigerator in a pint glass.		Poured a hazy orangey copper with a small foamy white head, decent retention, settled into a creamy, sudsy lacing.		Aromas of earthy pine and citrus, mainly grapefruit and orange rind, with a light backing of caramel and biscuits.		Good, even carbonation and a crisp, dry with a little hop roughness in the palate, creamy smooth medium bodied mouthfeel.		Pleasant, enjoyable IPA taste, earthy, resiny, dry hoppiness along with some citric rind bitterness, a light numbing of the tongue, sweet sugary, caramel maltiness, a soft backing to hops, some grain breadiness as well, and a dry sour hoppy and sweet malty finish.		An easy, quaffable drinkability, I thought it had a nice balance, for me personally, a welcome addition to the shelves here in Illinois.
",5
190,"Thanks to Hopdog for this one as part of Mystery Swap #2.  Pours hazy medium copper with luscious 2-finger off-white head.  Aroma of wet hops, tropical fruit (tangerine, grapefruit, honeydew, even cherry and berry notes), heavy black pepper.  Tastes hoppy, with a firm caramel malt base, plus some fruity notes.  It stays a bit sticky and on the sweet side, with more citrus as it warms.  This one is very good.  A tad more complexity and balance would have catapulted this one into the low to mid 4.0 pantheon.
",5
191,"Pour is orange with a white head.  Aroma is a very nice and deep pine hop with a malty backbone.  Flavor loses something.  Still there are decent amount of pine and citrus hops along with some caramel malts.  Still pretty decent as this has a decent hop kick to this one.
",5
192,"These labels are just too busy; I like the information but this is ridiculous. Hazy dark orange pour, looks thick for the style. Somewhat diminishing white head. Aroma is big on salty grapefruit. Also noted are grassy hops, tangelos and dry malts. Smells nice enough, somewhat boring but very unique. Flavor is nice if not uninteresting. More fruit, now more like fruit juice, big orange rind and a little pepper. Finishes off dry. The palate is very nice, carbonation is complimentary. Medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall a very satisfying pale ale.
",5
193,"the nose is maltier than i expected, at least at first; and for an IPA, this is not what i want... but pine resin biscuits are apparently inviting - the flavor mimics, and leaves a dry hoppy taste, not to be without the typical floral and citrus notes. however, it seems too earthy (the maltiness that i seem to want to sense more than the hoppiness) and astringent (the citrus is taken more from rinds than the juicy fruits, if you know what i mean) for me, but i still like it.
",5
194,"Slightly more malty than hoppy in aroma and flavor.  Not bad really, a lingering bitter finish helps this clean up decently.

195,"Bottle. Really enjoyed this for a single IPA.  Very citrusy and floral. I thought there was a good malt/hop balance. Appearance is a nice copper with a small head that lasts and good lacing on the glass.

197,"[Bottle] Dark amber pour with about a half inch of white foam on top. Citrus and pine hop aroma is actually pretty subdued. Typical grapefruit, orange zest and astringent grassy hops in the taste. The malt profile is there, but mainly bready and weak. Average carbonation levels. An easy drinker, but very run-of-the-mill.

201,"Bottled@Monks Caf Wallingatan, Stockholm. Deep golden colour with a mediumsized off-white head. Aroma is citrus fruits, mild tropical fruits as well as some crisp bready and sweet maltyness. Flavour is fruity, floral and rather malty with a crispy bite. tonguetickling carbonation. Balanced and quite nice not too sweet IPA.
",5
202,"Pours a hazy orange, with a quickly diminishing white head.  Hops smell of the wacky weed.  Heavy mari-ju-ana.  I sniffed it for awhile, although it wasnt the smell I was quite looking for.  Tastes kind of like plants and weeds.  Very earthy to be politiclly correct.  I really dont get that grapefruit that I usually get with IPAs.  It needed maybe a different kind of hops.
",1
203,"12 oz. bottle courtesy boboski.  Strong pine resin aroma with a musky character to it.  Orangish-yellow with a soapy white head.  Palate thin to medium, very drinkable.  Moderate hop start to the taste, not a whole lot of hop character in the finish.  A pretty drinkable, good IPA.
",5
204,"12oz bottle acquired in trade with Sephiroth (thanks!). Poured a deeper amber/orange color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of citrus, grapefruit, pine, light caramel, and had a floral/green hoppiness to it. Tastes of grapefruit, oranges, light caramel, and had a sugary sweetness to it as well.  Not overly bitter. Not bad, a beer I could sit down and drink a sixer of.

207,"2006 bottle from MI2CA drunk on 1/11/07Cant figure out the bottling methods of these guys.  It says unfiltered/unpasteurized on the bottles, though it dosent say bottle conditioned.  The bottle of barrel-aged oatmeal stout was one of the most filtered, watery, loose tasting beers Ive ever had nor did it have any sediment.  This one, howver, has some definite protein dropout, which despite my best efforts got in to my glass, and the very last shot in the bottle (for experimentation) is completely cloudy.  The ruby-auburn-tinged caramel body is light on carbonation, though a fair amount of dark beige head does form, showing medium retention and little/no lacing.Sweet cherries and strawberries in the nose brush against the nose rather coarsely, while leafy, green hop aromatics provide grapefruit and orange rind notes.  Definite crystal maltiness sweetens things to a point, then seems to harden and dry out, with light yeast doughiness and moderate breadiness.  Every subsequent smell, however, is alive with fresh hop aromatics, fruity esters and balanced, sweet malt, it just seems to suffer on the finish, somewhat.  So based on the aroma, I suppose the evidence is in favor of it being unpasteurized at least.  Well have to leave it to the flavor/texture to determine the rest.Bittersweet malt and hops collide, with a strong earthiness and tangy grapefruit flavors that both give way to a ruby red grapefruit sweetness mixed with cherries and moderate herbal notes.  Whatever the medium malt being used, it comes across clearly and quite well.  The caramel-toffee sweetness is well matched and for once some hop acidity is much appreciated in balancing it.  Mostly substantial texture, with moderately engaging carbonation.  Ok, Ill buy that this stuff is lightly to not filtered and just conditioned well.  Not sure on the carbonation, I suspect its forced, but thats ok, Ill let them off the hook for that.  It comes across well enough.
",5
208,"draft - Pours copper colored with a moderate head that leaves some lacing.  Theres a good floral hop aroma.  The flavor features citrus hops supported by some caramel malt.  Medium bodied and lightly carbonated, Barfly has a long, bitter finish.  Maybe its better on tap as I was more impressed with this beer than most reviewers.
",5
209,"Bottle.  Grapefruit and orange aroma, lots of hops with a strong apparent bitterness to match the tang.  Floral aromatic hops.  Clear orange-amber pour with a thick creamy beige head.  Bitter and bone-dry, on the resiny side of the hopcoin, yet not really oily.  Grapefruit and citrus, indeed, but light caramel, too.   Aftertaste is a mix of hops and drying darjeeling.  Medium-light body is smooth and very quaffable.  A little too straightforward, but still pretty nice.  This could be divisive, and I on the favoring side.
",5
210,"Bottle... Murky amber ale with a small, creamy, white head. Lots of large floaties. The aroma is of dark malts and herbal hops. Bitter flavor for certain, but interesting... grapefruit rind with whispers of caramel and milk chocolate. Medium-bodied with a callous mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Finishes with bitter tannins and then bone-dry. Kudos to MI2CA for floating this bottle my way!

211,"On draught at Scottys Brewhouse in Indy. Bartender gave us a pitcher instead of a single glass. I hate it when that happens! ;-)  Anyway, it poured a slightly hazy orange IPA with caramel malt and slight citrus in the nose. Taste was similar with additional sweet malt, almost like nutty grape-nuts. Great bitterness in the finish.

212,"12oz. bottle.  Hazy orange color with a small film of white head.  Earthen and mild citric aromas.  Caramel and hard roll malt flavors with a vegetal and slightly spicy hop character.  Lemony hop flavors in the finish, with a residual woody astringency and ruddy maltiness.  Mouthfeel is medium, fairly dry.

213,"Sampled with Beerdrenched.  Pours hazy orange / bronze with a smallish eggshell white head.  The aroma has lots of floral / grapefruit hops - not too much more to the aroma, but the hops are great.  Medium body with some soft carbonation.  Taste has woody / pine hops with enough caramel malt to lightly balance out.  The finish has dry woodiness.  Very enjoyable IPA.

216,"I had a six pack of this while visiting friends in Noblesville, Indiana. Aroma is citrus, and florals. The flavor is a little different from any other IPA ive had. It starts out floral-like, but only for a split second before it turns into an acidity dryness, and finishes monotonous. It wasnt horrible, but it could use some work. It does accomplish being different. Maybe thats the ""tavern style""

217,"This bottled brew poured a medium sized head of fine to medium sized white colored mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a transparent orange brown colored body with small sized floaties and a thick lacing.  The aroma was of mild hops and the mouth feel was also hoppy and tingly from start to finish.  The flavor was a good mix of caramel and strong hops.  Just slightly on the yummy side.

218,"BottleSmall white fizzy head that was mostly lasting, decent amount of lacing, visible carbonation, hazy, and an orange brown hue. Nose was sweet, caramel, malty, citrusy, grapefruit, and hops.

",5
219,"12 oz. bottle. I get to give this one its ranking among other beers! And in this competitive style, it does hold its own. Big piney hop aroma from the time I pop the cap. Pours a pleasing orangey IPA color, with the carbonation surging into a fluffy head that shortly dissolves to lacing. Pretty clear until you spot the microscopic Bells-type floaties. Taste to my mind is again more of big resiny pine boughs than citrus. But still, its very tasty and filling, and brings out the malts, which appear to be a tad darker in roast than other IPA, a bit more caramel and over-toasted bagel. Its very enjoyable, and distinctive, especially for a bottled IPA. My label says ""Tavern style India Pale Ale."" I have never found a tavern with anything this good.
",5
220,"This IPA pours an orange gold color from a 12oz bottle. Small to medium sized white foamy head. Aroma is floral and herbal hops, touch of toffee and sweetness. A medium bodied IPA. Malts are caramel and sweet. Hops are herbal, grapefruity and citrusy, touch of pepper. There is a lots of bitterness to this IPA, but its not that harsh. Summit hops alpha acids at work here? Nicely balance. Good carbonation. A very drinkable IPA. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is bitter.

221,"Growler from Hippie4beer.  Thanks Seth. I had to drink this right away (chilled in the freezer) cuz it leaked a little in shipment.  Help up pretty well though- lost most of the carbonation obvously.  Pours a slight haze very light amber. Aroma is light sulfer, lots of yeast, and mildly hoppy.  Flavor is lightly yeasty, light solvent, light sulfur, sharp caramel malts, moderatley hoppy and a nice somewhat harsh bitterness.  Pretty good, but I bet would be even better fresh on tap.  Thanks Seth! Shame I couldnt share this with any other ratebeerians for them to rate.

222,"Sweet roasted caramel maltiness s the prdominant flavor upfront...a surprisingly heavy malt bottom.  But the PNW hopping quickly takes the upperhand and  delivers a punch of earthy/floral notes and citrus/grapefruit highlights.   Nicely brewed and very, very sessionable!

223,"From the bottle, this pours a thick, hazy orange with a continual slow bubbling and a modest light ecru head.  The aroma is dominated by the hops, grapefruit and a sharp floral scent, with some sweet malt seeping through.  The mouthfeel is thick and fizzy, tickling the tongue.  No definitive malt flavor shines through, but its sweetness adds some balance to the citric, earthy hop bitterness that takes over the taste.  Nice bitter finish.

225,"Draft at Keg Liquors Fest of Ale 2006.  Pours a light amber with a full white head and excellent lacing.  The aroma was very floral, with the summit hops coming through strongly.

Pours cloudy orange with a nice big fluffy head and great lacing.  Flavor is chewy, earthy hops with some citrus snap.  Not incredibly bitter due to the well balanced nature of the brew.  Palate is tart and very smooth.  Smells like a IIPA and tastes like a great American IPA.  This is easily the best brew Ive had from Barley Island.

234,"A clear copper pour with frothy off-white head and good lacing.  It has a pleasant grapefruit and pine aroma.  The medium body has average carbonation and slick texture.

238,"Not a big fan of this.  Maybe Barley Island didnt classify it correctly.  Really spicy ale.  Im a simple IPA guy....gimme the hops, citrus and caramel.  Leave the rest out of it.
",5
239,"Defintely veers toward the malty end of the IPA style and, to tell you the truth, at 5.6% ABV, I think Id just go ahead and call this a pale ale--not that that is a bad thing at all. Slightly hazed orange color with a small, foamy head. Something about the hops/malt balance in this beer reminds me of an American  barleywine though, of course, at a much more moderate level. The malts are more dominant but the hops are strong and cant be ignored. Its sweet w/ melon and pine hop notes along w/ a gentle iced tea astringency. By the end of my glass I am definitely ready to say that this is not an IPA but, whatever it is, I like it just fine. Its well balanced in its own way and while its not the most vibrant thing in the world, I cant complain about anything.

240,"A: Pours a cloudy copper color with a nice foamy head. Pretty good retention with some spotty lace.		S: Aromas of bitter citrus and grassy hops with a hint of underlying sweet malt.		T: Highly hopped. Lots of citrus and grassy green hops. Mild sweet pine, and enough bready and caramel malt to provide a bit of balance. That being said more hops than malt here.		M: Medium in body, smooth, sticky, almost a DIPA if you ask me.		D: Good, I would rate this as a real solid IPA/DIPA. Would keep it around if it was local to me due to the price point.

243,"6 pack purchased by jogringo, thanks man.  Pour is almost-clear rich copper color with a medium white head that quickly dissipates.  Aroma is hoppy and malty.  Hop component is mostly citrus with notes of resin and rosemary. Caramel malt provides a light sweetness with a slightly grainy component. Flavor is a well-integrated compilation of sweet caramel malt, light resinous hop, and cleansing citrus hop.  Maybe a touch thinner body than I was hoping for. Perfect way to relax down after moving most of the day.  Solid.

244,"Acted a little weird when I opened the bottle and poured it into a glass. Beer immediately foamed out of the bottle but when I poured it straight into the galss, got only minimal tan fine head with some texture which quickly settled down to a light cover and a bit of lace.

245,"Tap at the broad ripple location.  Pours cloudy amber with thick foamy white head. Nose is fairly intense citrus hops.  Taste is sharp and crisp juicy orange/grapefruit hops with moderate carbonation and a mild peppery spice to it.  Kinda salty in the finish actually.  Not bad.

271,"Found this one bottled at a liquor store in St. John, Indiana, as part of a mix 12 pack of various beers from Indiana brewers. Cloudy, medium brown pour with a lacy head, a mild, malty nose, flavor is a bit on the soft side for a pale ale, but still the hoppiness is omnipresent, with plenty of muted citrusy and flowery hoppiness.  A decent brew -- and I wonder why the ""tavern style?""

272,"Pours a kind of muddy brown. There was not much nose to it at all. Flavor was on the sweet side, lots of carmel to it with a bit of hop at the finish. Really could use more hop to balance the malt, but its nice.

273,"A fairly mild IPA. Pours a hazy orange, with a quickly diminishing white head. Average floral hop aroma. Unfiltered honey color with a medium uneven head. Mild bitterness with a dry finish. Did not enjoy this and was very hard to finish, nearly a drain pour.

274,"Pours orange with a white head. Heavily carbonated. Aroma is of weak hops, alcohol, dirt, caramel, grass, and malt. Doesnt smell very attractive. Taste is of hops that are way past their prime, dirt, grass, and citrus. Has a backbone of dirty malt soaked in caramel and smegma. Mouthfeel is very carbonated. What a very unpleasant beer, with no drinkability or redeeming factors. A dismal dissapointment.

282,"Scent of citrus and other fruits.  Fairly strong hop flavor, however, this flavor is only average compared to other IPAs.  This also means the beer is not as dry as most IPAs, which is a plus for me.  Aside from the hops, there is really no other flavor present.  If I am going to go through the bitterness of this IPA, I would like there to be more to it.  But there isnt.

Largish, frothy off-white head decays slowly above the dusky, murky walnut body.....light hazelnuts and vanilla are almost subsumed in a somewhat off sour grapiness that muscles into the nose....the body is quite dry, lightly tart in the middle and rather burnt/toasted at the finish, with again a bit of grapy sourness that just doesnt work; the nutty, dark malts are there, but barely so....body is on the thin side, carbonation is strong and soda-like; quite dry on the palate.

Same notes in the mouth, earthy nuttiness dominating with gritty roast right behind.  Burnt and dry.  Aftertaste the same but with lingering hops.  A lot of flavor for a not-very-full body.  Pretty damn good for a Brown Ale, even manages to avoid most notes of sweetness... but still, just a brown ale.

330,"Bottle: A carmel brown hue with a fizzy tan head which lasted but did not produce much lace.

331,"A very red beer, barely brown, with a dense, tan head that laces well down the glass.  Aroma of bakers chocolate and caramel with a touch of warm fermented fruitiness but lacking complexity.  Flavor and aroma are one with the addition of a nice, long bitterness and hop flavor that extends the finish and some milk on the palate.  It seems a little thin for an American brown ale, not very complex, but I know how hard it is to brew this style of beer and include complexity.  It has a great drinkability.

332,"Slightly hazy brown with a full tan head.  Aroma is malty, but strange.  It has a husky and somewhat nutty aroma that is very briefly remenisient of peanut butter.  Flavor is first sweet then has a sharp malt tang that isnt necessiarly welcomed.  Tangyness settles on the pallate and takes over.  It lends a bit of a decent grist malt character.  A bit of a redeaming malt sweetness as it warms.

340,"As it sets in the glass an unblurred mahogany color, the head is modest in size, frothy in its texture and a winsome light tan in color as it vanishes quite quickly a patchy sheet of rather thick lace remains to protect the glass. Sweet malt is dominate, crisp fresh and clean with a vanilla and nut like tones also present, begins malt sweet with the top light to medium in feel. Finish has a mild carbonation, hops unassuming in their spiciness, dry and lingering aftertaste, also noticed a bit of burnt grain in the aftertaste, a drinkable beer. Interesting name must look up and see what history lies behind that name, always a point of interest with me.

Rather dry with a low fruitiness, but overall pretty nice.		4.0 T: Taste is much like the nose. Nutty, toasty, biscuity malts, and toffee are all there again. Theres a barely detectable almost buttery flavor (though not exactly buttery) than complements the flavors well. A little sweeter than the nose suggests, but not much.

363,"This is a deep red brown in color. The head is quite large, rocky and of large bubbles. I prefer a head thats a bit more even but this is nice too. Pine hops up front in the nose w/ an woody undercurrent. Hop bitterness is firm but a bit on the soapy side. Really not bad though. The biggest problem this beer has is that its overcarbonated which makes it come across as a bit watery and drowns out any sort of malt depth this might otherwise have. It is very sharp on the tong which detracts from drinkability somewhat as well. There seems like there is a decent beer going on somewhere here but the flaws override most anything enjoyable about it.

371,"Read about this beer in an in flight magazine, Southwest I think, so I was curious to try it.  Nice light aroma and flavor. A little lighter and thinner than I expected, yet a very nice overall experience.

375,"12 oz. bottle, $9.50/6pack at Binnys. Popped when the Colts drew first score. Pours a big tan head over a brown body what shows light though as ruby highlights. Hell, as fine-looking a beer in this style as I know. Smell is mostly brown malts, a bit of Crystal, and this is a new enough bottle that I get some nice grassy fresh hops smell. Taste is lighter than the Newcastle minikeg Ive been draining; a bit more caramel with a hint of coffee. No distractions in this beer travels from my lips to my throat. Just a darn fine brown ale.

376,"Hazy orangish copper with a one finger beige quickly dissolving topper.  Aroma of nuts, sweet malt, ample, brown sugar and no real hop aroma.  Taste of caramel, mild nuttiness.  Cola-like and sweet the sweetness has kind of a funky aftertaste that just hangs.  Okay.

378,"Dark brown body with a sudsy light brown head.  Pleasant aroma of sweet malt, brown sugar, and just a touch of hops.  Smooth, but slightly thin palate.  Overall sweet flavor with brown sugar and caramel giving way towards the end for a decent spicy bite.  Not a bad brew.

379,"On tap at the Bloomington Beer Festival. Poured chestnut with a light brown head. Aroma was malty with a bit of an acidic coffee bite. Flavor was well balanced with malty flavor that dominates a lesser bitter hop flavor.

385,"Found this one bottled at a liquor store in St. John, Indiana, as part of a mixed 12 pack of various beers from the state.  Hazy, medium brown pour with a thick, tan head, a nice malty nose, chocolatey and a bit of baked bread enhance this nice, malty ale.  An impressive brew in a so-so style.
",5
386,"Six pack from Kahns, Indianapolis.  I only bought it because my wifes name is Helene.  Turned out though to be not that bad.  Nice malty backbone that reminded my of Newcastle Brown.  A bit rough about the edges, but a drinkable beer.

387,"Hazy brown pour with one finger of tan head. Rich malty aroma with a hint of hops. Malty roasted grain flavors with hints of chocolate and coffee  just hints - dominate the start, with a decent, although one dimensional, hops bite coming through in the finish. A thoroughly respectable ale.
",5
388,"Pours brown with a small off white head.  Aroma is faint but of dark fruits and light malts.  Flavor is slightly roasty, slightly hazelnut and a slight sour bitterness which may have something to do with the age of the bottle.  Not bad but not great.

392,"Bottle thanks to my girlfriends trip to Louisville. Pours a slightly murky red brown with fizzy tan head. Nose is munich malt and crystal malt, minimal spicy hops in the background. Wet cereal and a touch of chocolate. On taste, slight roast, biscuity notes, finish is sweet. Enough bitterness to balance. A bit effervescent. Thin body. Not bad.

397,"Thanks to Bobby91w for the extra! Pours a murky reddish brown, like a good barley wine. Thin head. Very sweet-smelling, with lots of ripe fruits - some bright enough to be called tropical, and some darker (figs, dates). A bit of apple cider, and some light brown sugar - definitely mostly malts. Hops are barely present. Flavor is equally sweet, but more like caramel or even butterscotch than brown sugar. Watery palate, but what flavor is there is very pleasant. This ones worth more than the score it has, I think - not fantastic, but satisfying enough.
",1
398,"Bottle. Dirty brown pours with a substantial, but diminishing tan head. The aroma is malty with notes of roasted malts, chocolate and nuts. Hint of metal. The flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter and lightly acidic. The finish remains sweet with a slight tartness and only a hint of bitterness. Medium body with a lively carbonation and watery texture. Off flavors of butterscotch and metal.

401,"8/04/2008:  Dirty Helen Tavern Style Brown Ale is brown in color with golden highlights and a thin, speckly veil.  A faint caramelly-molasses-nutty aroma is barely evident.  The flavor is even more elusive which is okay based on what can be found which includes: steeped roasted malt or bark, sour/burnt malt and fruit but sometimes vacantly sweet, and something slightly nutty.  Weird.  Doesnt even quite cut it to be just ""average"".  This beer feels overly thin and watery on the palate and is completely unexciting.  Overall this is a very disappointing beer that misses the mark.  I am quite surprised by how poor this particular beer is considering the quality of several of Barley Islands other offerings, most noteably the Barfly IPA and Majic Java Stout...	12 fl. oz. bottle from tish.  Thanks!  Rating #69 for this beer...
",1
402,"Bottle purchased at Corral Liquors in Granite City, IL. Pours a hazy burgundy with a finger of somewhat creamy, beige head that diminishes to a thin cap. The nose is of a somewhat astringent burnt caramel that transitions to an ""off"" phenolic/plastic note; not terribly enticing. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium-bodied and almost creamy-slick, finishing mildly dry and astringent. The flavor follows the nose with an additional roasted nut note. This is a decent brown, but the astringency and plastic note detract from the overall effect. Its not bad, but its not particularly good either.
",1
403,"A good session brown. Slightly hoppy, nutty flavor thats a tad too watery, but fairly standard for a brown. Pours a light brown with a thin head and some good lacing. The malt character of this one actually is pretty good. Nothing too much jumps out about this one.
",1
404,"This brown ale pours a fairly transparent brown amber colour with a small head. Hardly any lacing, this light bodied brown leaves you wondering if there could have been more. Pleasent, yet not very complex it is a friendly tasting brew.
",1
405,"12 oz. bottle courtesy of a trade with BBB63.  Pours a mostly clear dark brown with a very thin off-white head that had completely vaporized before my first sip.  Pleasnt aroma of lightly roasted malt and some floral hops.  The flavor is similar with light roast up front and moderate hops bitterness at the finish.  The aroma is perhaps a bit sweeter than the actual flavor.  As others have mentioned, not deserving of its low percentile rank - should probably be around 50 percent.
",1
406,"Umber color with hints of garnet when held to the light. Modest, but stable beige head. Grainy aromas with hints of DMS. Some toasted to lightly roasted malts as well in the scent. Light malt sweetness with a touch of toasted biscuits. Herbal hops kick in the middle. Some earth dry malt flavors also come out in the finish and linger. Slightly unclean, but fairly drinkable brown.
",1
407,"had bottle brought up to me from a freind. Nice brown murky color, nice frothy head, nose is nutty some malt sweetness. Flavor is slightly nutty a little odd fruityness and not really much in the direction of hops, dry finish.
",1
408,"Nice looking beer.  It is a cola color with a cool tan / pumpkin head that hangs around for a while.  Aroma is sweet roasted malt and a bit of hop.  The beer itself is not as sweet as the aroma would indicate.  It is a roasted and bitter flavor and is reminiscent of a porter.  Feels smooth and creamy.  In my book this is an underrated beer at 39%.
",1
409,"Nice, dark brown brew with a slightly yeasty taste to it. You can easily smell the aroma hops from this, but it tastes quite bready. A nice beer to have sitting on the porch waiting the sky for whatever, its not too strong and certainly can compliment the senses.
",5
410,"33 cl bottle, Indianapolis, IN. Cola colour, faint sweet malt aroma that transfers to the flavor. Some sharp aftertaste on the finish, otherwise a decent beer.
",1
411,"Typical brown ale aromas. Dark brown color with a beige ring for head. Medium to full body with fizzy/creamy carbonation. Flavor is roasted caramel with a good amount of non-descript bitter. Its ""sweet"", but not very. The bitter tends to balance it out. More like an APA where the malt got a little too intense. It does seem a tad floral, so that may suggest English similarities. Its a damn good drink, and I suggest it is somewhat underrated.
",1
412,"This is a ok brown ale, but really not that different from anything else.  Dogfish Heads  Indiana Brown and Bells Best Brown Ale are better examples of a brown ale.  This is pretty standard, but not as bad as 37 percentile.
",1
413,"Pours dark reddish brown with a mostly receding wispy tan head. Aroma of nuts. caramel, alefruits and crackery crystal malt. Taste is sweet chocolate, toffee, mild English hoppiness with some of the earthy characteristics I like from Fuggles. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with soft carbonation. Pretty easy drinking, quaffable brown ale.
",1
414,"Decent brown ale.  Cloudy and unfiltered.  Fruity malt taste.  Presents better than it tastes.  Very interested to visit the brewery in Noblesville.
",1
415,"Typical brown ale with an accentuated sense of smokiness.  The palate is too thin for real enjoyment--it didnt tingle or glow on the tongue--and it slips into nothingness.  Still, it was drinkable and an easy beer to not find annoying.  Sessionable.
",1
416,"Bottle.  Felt like more of a doppelbock than a Brown Ale to me -- very boozy somehow for a 4% beer.  Didnt really get any flavors outside of brusque alcohol and maybe some hops.  A very different beer from Newcastle and I strongly prefer the former.  Best part of this beer is the color: its a beautiful dark red-brown.  Best paired with cold weather and limited expectations.

The brew is dark walnut with ruby highlights.  The slow cascade meanders into a tan creamy head that is mostly lasting with good lace.

422,"UPDATED: AUG 11, 2006 Had this one from the tap at the brewery. Poured dark with decent head. Has aroma of dark chocolate and coffee. Flavor is pretty smooth consisting of same dark chocolate/coffee taste. This was first porter so I dont have much to compare it to. 		Update- Second trial 07/01/06		For some reason the July batch seemed to have lost some of its flavor. Seemed to be watered down

423,"Tap at brewery - Aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, and a touch of coffee.  Pours black with nice brown lasting head and great lacing.  Flavor touches aroma character but doesnt follow up.  Palate is smooth and creamy but too thin.  Tasty and easy drinking, but the body is  too light for a porter.
",5
424,"A stinker. Hoppiness would be appropriate with some malt present, but unfortunately, this is maybe the lightest porter on the planet, so the hoppiness seems overdone. I have homebrewed for 17 years and have been disappointed with porters better than this. Three cheers for Diet Porter (or not)!!!

425,"Growler shared by Scott.  Pours out dark brown with a faint tinge of burgundy.  Small tan head left some lacing for as long as it lasted.  Aroma was roasted coffee, some notes of chocolate, malt powder.  It was a bit thin in the mought and low in alcohol for a porter.  The flavor was pleasant.  The coffolate combo with a smathering of malted milk balls.  Nice drink.

426,"On tap.   Very flavorful porter.  Definitely better than average.  It has the roasty malts flavor that is preferable for a dark variety.

427,"From a sampler: This beer pours a dark brown color with a ruby tint. Medium-thin beige head and sticky lacing at the top of the glass. The aroma consists of coffee and burnt chocolate. Medium-bodied and smooth with a decent mixture of coffee, chocolate and malt flavors. The hops come through pretty well in the finish. Overall this is a well-balanced and fairly well-done Porter.

435,"From notes. Pours the standard orange with a frothy white head. Aroma was nice, notes of spice and citrus, with a touch of pine and grass. Grass come through stronger in the flavor, as does the lemon and citrus peel. Very light mouthfeel. Pretty crisp and refreshing. Another good session beer from BI.
",5
436,"On tap at the brewpub.  Pours murky orange with a thick white head.  Very nice aroma of of sweet orange peel, light corriander, and wheat.

",5
437,"Pours light golden with a mostly receding foamy off-white head. Aroma of banana, spicy phenolics, orange peel. Taste is orange peel, banana, light malt. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lightly creamy from the yeast with lush carbonation. Pretty nice witbier.

438,"Looks like they brought back an old one. 4oz draft sample at the brewpub. Color is slightly cloudy straw gold. Aroma is spices and cloves. Taste is over spiced cloves and banana with that belgian yeast flavor. Rather typical belgian wheat, IMO, but the spices and clove were a little strong for me. Fine beer, nothing spectacular.

439,"pint at BI - Aroma is yeasty with sharp spice and citrus as it warms.  Pours cloudy brown-yellow with no head and decent lacing.  Flavor matches aroma with a little banana.  Palate is creamy and smooth with some  tartness in the finish.  Not bad and easy drinking.

446,"Tulip at BI - Strong aroma of dark chocolate, coffee, tobacco, brown sugar and charcoal.  Flavor has some molasses, burnt dark chocolate malt, dark roast coffee and a touch of bitter hops.  Alcohol is too strong in the flavor.  Palate is ashy and sticky.  Interesting and tasty.
",5
447,"Hand bottle... Pours dark with a bubbly, light brown head. The aroma is a glorious swirl of sorghum molasses, pipe tobacco, chocolate and espresso. Full-bodied with a velvety mouthfeel and faint carbonation. The flavor is bold with lots of bittersweet blackstrap molasses and dark chocolate. Black malt and the accompanying ashy bitterness is added to attempt balance. In that regard, this beer fails. However, Im not always looking for balance. Im looking for interesting malts and hops and originality. So far, this brew is grossly underrated. Give it another try... or dont... your loss. Bottle shipped to me by StFun!
",5
448,"tap at the brewpub - Pours black with a thin, tan, lasting head.  The flavor is of dark roast malt, some coffee and an alcohol taste thats too forward.  It needs more going on with bigger flavors to keep up with the abv.  Its alright, but for the style, my favorite style in fact, it was really lacking.

449,"Tap at BI, this was a real crowd-pleaser at my table.  Pitch pour with light brown head.  Heavy booze aroma with some fusels floating around on top of the chocolate.

450,"UPDATED: MAR 10, 2009 New one from Barley Island. Not quite as good as Beastie Barrel, but sessionable nonetheless. Aroma is a tad weak; roasted grain and chocolate.

Not sure this should be qualified as a ""Sweet Stout"", its too ""burnt"", but its a pretty good Stout nonetheless.

455,"12 oz bottle shared with padrefan.  Very chocolate and roasty malts on the aromas.  Nice dark pour with a decent head.  I should have just smelled this one all day.  The flavor fell off a bit with some metallicness and a sour twang that didnt seem to fit in.

456,"Bottle (12oz).  Shared with blankboy, biegaman and tupalev - blankboys bottle.  Deep ruby-brown, small frothy off-white head.  Sweet roasty aroma, very light hops.  Malty, bitter and roasty - long bitter finish.  Slick astringent body, fairly flat, carbonized.  Good, not great - a little too burnt for a ""sweet"" stout.
",5
457,"12oz bottle from the Hop Shop.  Pours black with a fair tan head that stays a bit and leaves some lace.  Aromas of dark chocolate, some coffee, and some roasted and burnt malts.

Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and a dry finish.
",5
458,"a very very good oatmeal stout.  IMO this rivals Goose ISlands and thats my current fave.  this is full bodied and nutty.  the aroma is walnut, almond, and chestnut with toasted marshmello with a LOT of roasted malt that gives this beer the feel that it itself was roasted on a barbeque.  interesting.  flavor is LOTS of nutty flavors with some marshmellow and graham cracker (Its a smore!!) with lots of milk chocolate and a little light roast coffee.

459,"Opaque beer with a small tan head.  A little thicker than what I remember of other oat stouts.  A very sharp bitterness/roastedness in taste that leads to a bitter finish.  Faint grassy hops in aroma and taste.

461,"Bottle.  Malty chocolate and roast aroma, touch of air let out of a tire.  Pours opaque black with a soon-gone dark brown head.  Bitter, roasted, and burnt taste.  The stale air continues to plague this one - is it oxidation?  Lasts through the aftertaste.  Potent initial taste, will give it that.  Some oats and acidity, and a light woody note to accompany the mild bitterness.  Medium-light body with an occasional swish of sweetish creaminess.  Touch of hop prickle in the finish.  Needs some work before I award it the seal of approval.

462,"Bottle... Pitch black ale with a tiny, creamy, light brown head; gone in a flash. Chocolaty, coffee nose with touches of light molasses, vanilla bean and oxidation.

Thanks to MIC2A for handing off the bottle prior to our short excursion to Jolly Pumpkin in Dexter, MI

463,"Pours close to black with a brown / orange head.  The aroma has roasted malt with cream.  There are some coffee notes along with bits of char and some vanilla.  Medium body with light carbonation.  The flavor starts with a light citric taste, then comes the char and coffee along with some dark chocolate.  The finish has some spice and then the char slips back in and stay with you.  A decent oatmeal stout - not sure of the age, but this seems like it was a bit aged and would be quite nice fresh.

464,"bottle-thanks to vyvvy for the sample.  pours deep brown, almost black with a soapy, big bubble brown head that changes colors depending on the swirl in the glass.  aroma is big fresh roeasted coffee, cigar, char, dusty esters, dark chocolate-really smells tasty!  nice char and dark chocolate flavors.  lightly metallic finish which hinders the flavor profile here.  body is somewhat thin and watery.  this is a fairly good oatmeal stout that would really rock fresh on tap!
",5
465,"Bottle and served in my Stone IRS snifter: Pours a deep brown hue that is close to opaque with a fading frothy tan head and the remaining ring left good lace upon the glass. The aroma has notes of chocolate, smoked, nutty malts, oatmeal, prune, coffee, and some grassy hops. The flavor profile is sweet mocha,  toasted grain, walnut, with a light background of acidic fruit and some mild bitterness. The aftertaste does display a bit more hop and coffee bitterness but not much. The mouth feel is medium bodied, slightly oily and carbonated just right matching the flavors. Well not huge or earth shattering, a solid Oatmeal Stout and quite drinkable. Worth another try, could be really good if found on hand pump.
",5
466,"Bottle. Pours black with minimal red hues coming out. A small tan head forms and disappears shortly. The aroma is smoky, oaty, and full of very dark mocha and toasted hazelnuts. Nicely roasty in the mouth with thin chocolate and a hint of instant coffee, though some tasty notes of toasted notes hold everything together. This is a pretty good quaff.

467,"UPDATED: FEB 4, 2007 draft - Pours black with a big, lingering head and nice lacing.  It has a decent oatmeal and roast malt aroma.  The flavor includes the roast malt and some coffee notes.  Theres very little hops to be found and a light, roasty finish.

468,"Bottle, thanks to NachlamSie. Pours thick and black like tar, with some mahogany only at the extreme edges; brown, slowly-fading head. The aroma has a lot of sweet chocolate, nuts, and some coffee and toffee. Come to think of it, it reminds me a lot of chocolate biscotti. The flavor is very nutty with some roastiness and bitter chocolate. The finish is mellow and toasty. Has a nice oily oat texture. I like it.
",5
469,"Timing is everything. This pours to a deep, opaque balck, with a long thick long lasting tan head and excellent lacing. Aroma is very strongly coffee, toffee and chocolate. Flavor is more of the same.....and malty. Thick body, and rich, warm finish. I drank this on a hot summer day, yet rated it as if I were having it in late fall, on a cool night. A good beer in the right place and time.

470,"Thick, dark, black body with no head.  Metllic, matly aroma -  its not really that great. just OK.  The flavor is surprising filled with bitter cocoa, and roasted malts.  I really dont detect anything oatmealish about this beer.  Slightly sweet finish.  Very light and refreshing, and would go well with food.
",1
471,"Bottled - rich dark pour with small tan head - roasty, coffee aroma - fairly strong, dry, dark chocolate taste - really quite pleasant - a little thin near the finish, but otherwise a nice, drinkable stout.

472,"UPDATED: JUN 3, 2006 12oz bottle-A nice malty coffee smell with a huge head and not sure if it was overcarbonated or infected. very faint dark roasted flavor on the front end but became more abundant on the back end.	Not good or bad.
",1
473,"12oz bottle acquired in trade atpayne (thanks!). Opened to a loud Psst. This one poured all head. Eventually settled into a dark black with red edges. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and some oatmeal. Nice aromas. Tastes of bitter coffee, with light chocolate and roasted malts. As expected with the pour, the body was on the over carbonated side.
",1
474,"Monster head that vanished quickly. Didnt do a whole lot for me at all. There was a long lasting semi bitter finish. But that was about it. Very bland.
",1
475,"Nice color and aroma, just not very stout for a stout. Taste was of coffee and malt. Malt flavors lingered a little too long.
",1
476,"Looked and smelled promising.  Picture perfect stout appearance (though the head deflated rapidly), and the aroma was spot on chocolately coffee.  The palate was watery and not creamy at all.  I would even say slightly gritty.  The taste of the beer left the most to be desired.  It was a shadow of its aroma mostly tasting like burnt coffee with the slightest sweetness and chocolate.  In the end, better than Guiness, but not by much
",1
477,"Dark beer, thin brown head.  Aroma is of chocolate and alcohol, but flavour is bitter, malty, chocolate aftertaste.  Palate is unpleasant.  Not too much flavour, and flavour doesnt match the aroma, nor do they even compliment each other.  not necessarily offensive but not amazing in any way.
",5
478,"Dark with thin tan head that quickly disapates.  Nice aroma.  Drinks very smooth, sweet with good balance of coffee and chocolate.  My first beer from Barley Island, and definately will go back and try others.
",5
479,"12oz - Aroma is rich and malty.  Roasted chocolate malt and oatmeal.  Pours black with medium brown head and good lacing.  Flavor matches aroma.  Palate is creamy and smooth.  An easy drinking stout.
",5
480,"12 oz bottle.  Poured a dark brown with a thin tan head. The nose was very malty. The flavor was fairly smooth with hints of chocolate malts, a bit of oat, and a little coffee.  Not as smooth as a lot of this style are, but a decent beer.
",1
481,"Bottle.  Pours a dark mahogany with a thin caramel color head which quickly disapates. Powerful aroma of sweet roasty malt.  Creamy texture that lasts.  Big time flavors with chocolate, vanilla, coffee all nicely balanced.  Thanks Em!
",5
482,"Black through and through with a nice chocolate color head.  Mild roasted oat flavors -- sort of like roasted cinnamon oatmeal.  Coffee nose.
",5
483,"Pours inky black with rich but minimal tan head, low carbonation.		Smells of cinnamon, hint of molasses, roasted coffee, cereal grains.		Viscous and chewy on the tongue, though low in carbonation.		Rich roasted chocolate up front, very syrupy with hints of hop presence on the back end.  Not too much different than most oatmeal stouts Ive tried, only richer.  Overall balance is exceptional.		Some may find the rich sweetness to be overbearing over the course of one or two pints, but not this guy.  Leaves a stickiness on the lips and palate, so it may be ruinous to the effect of follow up brews, but its reasonable enough to make a fine nursing beer over the course of an evening.
",5
484,"Surprisingly rich and full-flavored after sampling some of their other light/appease-the-masses offerings. Rich malty, roasty aroma. Velvety body thanks to oatmeal, very good balance of malt, roastiness and hop. Nice full body. Keep this one, kick up the Blind Tiger( a quite good, but underdone offering) and scrap everything else on the regular tap. You are in a great location - quit pandering to the masses. Make more beers like this and people will find them on reputation.
",5
485,"Poured an opaque black color with a huge tan head that left light lacing on the glass.  Aroma of creamy milk chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts, nuts, and dried fruit in the background.  Taste of roasted coffee, chocolate, faint hoppiness.  Carbonation / gritty mouthfeel, though it was still nice.
",5
486,"Pours black with big tan head.  Like the other Barley Island I tried, much too carbonated for the style.  Roasted malt and very light coffee in the aroma, and also a bit medicine-like.  A little bit of coffee in the aroma, but it is carried away with the over-the-top carbonation.  Thin on the palate.  Dont know how long ago bottled.  Either old bottles or poor process control leading to the medicinal aromas and flavors and high carbonations from this brewer.
",1
487,"Dark chestnut/garnet body topped by a small tan head.  Pleasant aroma of coffee, vanilla, chocolate, sweet malts.  Medium body with minimal carbonation, but a little on the watery texture.  The flavor was an appealing coffee/vanilla/chocolate blend.  This was quite a surprise and my thanks to beer buddy Brian for providing this treat.
",5
488,"Dark, frothy and with a touch of sweetness.  Light on the hops, but well orchestrated with the malts. A vanilla bean and light coffee prescence. Smooth on the palate and very drinkable. Id put it on the upper end of ""run of the mill"" stouts.
",5
489,"Deep chestnut brown body, thin light tan head.  Dry chocolate, mocha, and marshmallow aroma, quite toasty.  Sharp chocolate flavor, mocha, and toast with some roasted acidity.  Relatively thin-bodied with a decent flavor profile.  Bitter roasted malt finish.  Wood and even a hint of vanilla peek through the roasted malts; I understand why barrel-aging this beer was so successful.
",5
490,"Bottle pours black as night, large frothy light brown head, with attractive lacing.  Burnt malts, espresso, and cocoa on the nose.  Slight burnt malt, roastiness up front, but surprisingly this one has very little bite.  Fairly smooth mouthfeel, decent body, but the overall flavor is quite light.  Finishes very quick, and with only a sublte hint of roasted malts and hops.  Looks great, tastes good, but lacks any real umph.  Lingering hop bitterness.  Thanks goes out to atpayne for the trade! 
",5
491,"Bottle. Poured a small sized tan head with fine-medium sized bubbles that were mostly lasting. Uncarbonated, opaque and a dark brown hue. Malty, burnt, roasted and coffee nose. Coffee, roasted and burnt flavor from start to finish. Smooth palate. Fair lacing.
",5
492,"This bottled brew poured a small head of fine to large sized brown colored mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a good lacing.  The head was notably weird in that it had large sized bubbles on the left side of my mug and finely sized bubbles on the right hand side!  The body was opaque with no visible carbonation and light black in color.  The aroma was very nice with malt molasses and brown beer notes and a mildly vinous coffee scent.  The mouth feel was initially very thick with malty and mild coffee notes and a lingering mild coffee malt bite in the finish.  The flavor was thick with malt and coffee notes.
",5
493,"Opaque black color with a brown head at the pour that is quickly dissipated.  Sweet malt nose as befits the style.  Mouthfeel is full and smooth.  The initial taste is dry, but gives way to a proper sweet aftertaste.  Surprisingly complex, but not deeply so.  Decent effort.
",1
494,"Hometown brewpub, I'd like to see them succeed because Indiana needs lots of help converting the masses away from the commercial swill they are so used to drinking.  Nice deep brown color with a creamy dark tan head.  There was a good smoky aroma that overpowered anything else that may have been present.  The flavor was dominated by a combination of smoky and coffee roasted malts.  It's a decent beer but I've had much better stouts.
",1
495,"From a sampler: This is a beer that I wish I had brought home in a growler. It is also one available in bottles. Pours almost black with a thick tan head an good lacing. The aroma is a pleasant blend of roasted coffee, malt, and chocolate. Very rich and satisfying with a strong cocoa/coffee flavor. Malt, caramel and hops are all in there for good measure too. The finish is long and roasty. This is easily the best beer from the brewpub as far as I am concerned.
",5
496,"12oz bottle pour. leaves the bottle damn near black and with a minimal tan head. looks really nice in the glass! roasted malts, coffee beans and some chocolate hit your nose. the texture is creamy and full bodied. you pick up on some roasted coffee flavor and chocolate but neither are overpowering. very tasty.
",1
497,"Full bodied beer with a strong blend of malts and chocolate.  Pours pitch black and it great alone or with a meal.  Finishes smooth.
",5
498,"Sweet malts in aroma.  The flavor is mild coffee, chocolate and smooth in texture.  Subtle in flavor, the coffee is the dominating flavor although not dominating, a very good all the way through.
",5
499,"[Bottle] Nearly black, clear pour with a light brown head. Roasted malts, oatmeal, chocolate and coffee in the aroma. Similar roasted grain taste throughout. Distinct smoky notes add a pleasant dimension to this brew. Sweet chocolate and residual brown sugars keep this beer on the sweet side despite the smoke. Burnt bread and light vanilla hints in the finish. A nice body and pleasant finish. A good one.
",5
500,"Dark roasted malt aroma. Pours pitch black with thick brown head. Lots of dark malt flavor with lingering roast malt aftertaste. Some dark malt astringency which is okay.  Overall a very nice oatmeal stout.
",5
501,"12 oz. bottle. $1.60 single @ Binnys. Nice chocolatey smell in the bottle neck. Also in the glass, with no sourness like a regular stout, nor alcohol. Tan colored head atop a opaque black body. Taste is very smooth as befits an oatmeal stout. Dark malts without the bitter ""roastiness."" Malt is thick and sticky on my lip. Again, alcohol in moderation here. Easy to take down with no ill effects.I would wish this had secondary fermentation instead of carbonation for an even smoother texture, but its wonderful just as it is.
",5
502,"Much too decadent of a stout to be clocking in at a mere 4.9%; theres huge chocolate and mocha flavors abound in this bottle.  The hops are kept to a minimum, but the slick texture prevents any unwelcome sugar build-up on the finish.  Plus, the low ABV means you can drink a couple without risking tossing bar stools at the jukebox when ""Take On Me"" comes on.  (2008)
",5
503,"Bottle. Very thick head with chocolate dominating the aroma with a sweetness of syrup? Not as bold as I thought it was going to be from the smell. Still very rich and creamy. Wonderful after taste.  Sweet but well balanced. =)
",5
504,"Wasnt all that bad but definitely not great. The aroma was flat yet was there. Malty tasting. Slightly sweet. Pours nice with a tan head. Malty and roasty, but nothing inspiring.
",1
505,"Purchased at Bagel on Damen in Chicago, IL; enjoyed on a Monday night (first day back to work after Snowmaggedon 2011).  Pretty solid.  Aroma of mocha, chocolate, and heavy cream, very decadent.  Appearance pure black with a thin tan head.  Taste dominated by chocolate and lactose, also a bit of roasted malts, extremely smooth, really good stuff.
",5
506,"Now this is a stout!  Heavy, black, sweet.  Aroma of roasted malt, vanilla, chocolate, coffee.  Taste is dark malt with some hops thrown in for tempering.
",5
507,"12ozer from 21st Amendement Broad Ripple. Thin mocha head sits atop a deep dark brew. Smells incredible. Creamy, chocolatey, with a sweet roast. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Perfect weight in mouth. Bittersweet chocolate carries through. Bit of bitterness on the tounge. Mid roast. Bit thin on finish-could use a bit more there. But super solid beer here. Add this one to the rotation.
",5
508,"""Heavy cream scent with accents of cocoa and vanilla. Sweet with a big bitter push and ample creaminess. Roasted nuts, fudge, burnt toast and wood. A half inch head sits atop a dark brown body leaving good lacing. Nice one here.""
",5
509,"A: Pours a nice dark black hue. Nice tall tan head solid retention with nice chunks of lace.		S: Aromas of deep roasted malt, dark gas station coffee, chocolate, and cream.		T: Nicely roasted. Lots of coffee and dark chocolate as well. Hints of light smoke and ash.		M: Fairly thin, The oatmeal did not provide the slickness I expect in a great oatmeal stout.		D: Pretty good. Solid brew.
",5
510,"Trade bottle from StFun. Poured a dark black color with tan head. Aroma was very roasty, and mesquite like smoke. Taste was creamy, coffee, roasted malts. Pallet was smooth medium and silky. Overall I thought this was a good beer.
",5
511,"Bottle shared by joetheyounger.  Pours oily black with a dense tan head.  Aroma is roasty and chocolatey for the most part, maybe a bit of barbeque and toasted almonds.  Flavor is quite smoky and maybe some mesquite characteristics, along with a good deal of coffee.  Full bodied with soft carbonation.
",5
512,"(So... this has cellared 2+ years.) Inky black pour with mahogany highlights under a slow, thick head, the color of wet sand. Potently aromatic, mostly syrupy chocolaty sweetness with strong dark fruit undertones and a finishing punch of Boston-style coffee. Low cola notes late.  Palate is off, mildly syrupy yet spritzy and a bit watered-down. Skim milk? Flavor is spot-on with the aroma, Milk chocolate syrup leads to a bittersweet coffee finish. Mostly enjoyable.
",5
513,"12oz bottle from 2008 [been in my fridge the whole time].  Rating #100 of this brew.  Pours a gorgeous thick creamy shinny very near black with a great fine fizzy mocha creamy froth.  Aroma of nice creamy roast, seemingly woody from the oats, some sharp dark chocolate syrupy sweetness, faint touch of butter and molasses.  Flavor follows aroma exactly, woody dry roast, creamy dark chocolate, fairly bitter, seemingly quite dark, still some nice hop presence, off-dry feeling mouth-feel.  Medium bodied, creamy smooth with spread-out sharp fizzy carbonation.  Pretty good.
",5
514,"12oz bottle from Orland Park Binnys single rack. Pours very dark brown with thick dark tan head. Aroma is oats, roasted malt and chocolate. Flavor is mostly roasted malts and oats with some chocolate and finishes with some coffee bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and properly carbonated. Decent stout. Would be better with less coffee in my opinion.
",5
515,"Bottle at the Bloomington Beer Festival. Poured black with a dark brown head. Aroma was full of coffee and oat notes. Flavor had a combination of sweet chocolate and bitter coffee notes.
",1
516,"Dark brown pour with a beige head.  Aroma of lightly roasted coffee and semisweet chocolate.  Flavor is nutty with notable hints  of roast and bittersweet chocolate
",1
517,"Pours dark brown with a tan head.  Smells nutty with some roasty hints.  Tastes of sweet chocolate, some nutty hints.  Not much going on here.
",1
518,"Ho hum.  I was a bit surprised.  I liked the label and I had just had a Goose Island beer brewed for Trader Joes (the Black Toad Dark Ale)--perhaps the ""Island"" in the name made me think it would be as good, and the upgrade from a brown ale to an oatmeal stout would be an improvement.  But it wasnt much of one.  Rich, thick, for sure, but the flavors were thinner than expected...so malts, not so much roast, moderate coffee.  A little bitterness, a little flavor on the front end....but ho hum among the kingdom of stouts.
",1
519,"12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Black with a one finger mocha head. Aroma is sweet dark roasty malt, coffee.  Taste is similar with roasty dark sweet malt, dark bitter chocolate.  Very soft and milky texture perfect for the style. Not a bad oatmeal stout.
",5
520,"nose is a little black licorice, slightly bitter. pours black with very mild tan head.  palate is silky, like mosts oatmeal stouts.  taste is smokey and sweet, with mild bitterness.  i can definately taste the makings of my one of my favs, Black Majic.  A hint of alcohol fools you into believing this is high than it really is.  A pretty good oatmeal stout, but there certainly are better.
",5
521,"12oz bottle from StFun - thanks, Josh!!! Base beer for the Black Majic, apparently, and a nice one to try. First warm day of a Carolina spring and I want a roasty oatmeal stout? Eh, whatever. At any rate, I found it pleasant and unassuming. The nose is somewhat modest, decent roasted notes and a hint of creamy chocolate. Fizzy body is a bit of a surprise, given the style, and indeed its just a touch too thin for me. Nicely chalky finish, just like the coffee cousin. But the flavor profiles not nearly as complex as Id like it to be, even for a style made to session. Enjoyable even so, and big ups to Josh for giving me a chance to taste this.
",5
522,"Black pour with a tan head. Aroma of coffee, roasted, malts and burnt chocolate. Flavor of roasted malts. Burnt. Light to medium body.

523,"Black color with a dark tan head.  Slightly watery body (or maybe I just picky).  Decent, but average oatmeal stout.

524,"Notes from Indy Winterfest		Pours black with tan head. Aroma is of coffee and grains.  The flavor is like coffee grounds, chocolate, and malts.  Palate is normal.  Overall, an ok stout.

525,"12 oz bottle. Poured a dark brown with a thin tan head. The nose was very malty. The flavor was fairly smooth with hints of chocolate malts, a bit of oat, and a little coffee. Fairly priced around $2 a bottle.

526,"12oz via trade a ways back.  Pours black with a light brown head.  Nose is sweet with big coffee notes.  Taste is sweet and slightly chocolaty.  It is just ok.

527,"12oz bottle-pours a disappearing brown head and black color.  Aroma is bourbon, vanilla, dark malt/oat, dark tart fruit.  Taste is bourbon, vanilla, dark malt/oat, dark tart fruit.  Occasional.
",1
528,"Strong Coffee and Malt - I really like this flavor - very similar to the Bourbon Barrel Aged Oatmeal - (I will have to try the two at the same time to compare) I think I liked the flavor of the Bourbon Aged better.  This is a good brew
",5
529,"Mild burnt/roast malt, chocolate, coffee....all fairly subdued. The body is black with a mocha colored, thin head. Fairly strong coffee, mild chocolate. Sustained roastiness through the whole flavor range. Not a wower, but not at all a bad beer.
",5
530,"Dark pour with a brown crown of deliciousness.  I have to thank Optigon again for this, that dude is one hell of a trader.  I would never have tried an oatmeal stout otherwise.  I loved this brew.  Roasted malt, chocolate, lingering flavor on the palate and not overly thick as you would think.  Very good.
",1
531,"pour was dark with a very dark brown head.  Aroma was of chocolate, coffee, and dark roasted malt.  Flavor was coffee dominated melding well with light chocolate, malt, and a light bitterness. Well blended.  Good.  May buy again.
",1
532,"Bottle from fiver29. Poured dark brown color with average frothy brown head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate toasted chocolate malty aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture. Moderate toasted chocolate flavor with an average bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Good brew.
",5
533,"Bottle.  Aroma is oats, dark roast.  Opaque with a big cola colored head.  Flavor is light, dominantly charred oat and malts.  Light and thin in the mouth.
",1
534,"Pours black with a light tan head.  Has a nice aroma that has smooth roasty notes behind a slightly sweet hop smell.  Light to medium mouthfeel has a silky smooth feel.  Taste is a light roast with a creamy flavor.  Overall this is just a ok brew.  It was nice to try it.
",1
535,"Dark brown with a moderate light tan head. Aromas of husky grain and dark chocolate. Not a real strong scent. Quite dry throughout. Not as smooth as many oatmeals. Some light oatmeal and mild dark malts in the middle. Some light lactic qualities seek in here and there. Dry cocoa finish and linger. Easy to drink, but nothing too exciting.
",1
536,"Bottle from West Lakeview, Chicago.  Opaque black with medium creamy tan head.  Aroma is roasted malt, smoke, cherry or other sweet red fruit though the beer itself is very sweet in the aroma.  Roasted malt with slight smoke which is not as strong as the aroma, with definite oat characteristics and that same sort of cherry-like fruit.  Body begins medium and creamy but drops out at the end like a deflated balloon with the same sort of rubberiness.  Very nice all around but is missing and extra something or another to be perfect.
",5
537,"12 oz. bottle.  Pours a dark brown with light tan head.  Aroma of toasted bread, chocolate, and the smallest hint of vanilla..  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.  Flavor is dominated by roasted malt notes.  Some chocolate and a light bitter flavor at the end.  Nice beer.
",5
538,"Bottle shared with Tomthompson98. The aroma is very roasted coffee.  Good head and lace.  Sweetish, with lots of coffee and chocolate and an average mouthfeel.
",5
539,"very much pitch black, nice tan head that dissapears quick, nose is coffee, and some vanilla. Flavor is semi sweet bakers choc, some hops and caremel, maybe a little burnt flavor too, decent beer
",5
540,"Pours pitch black with a fully receding dark mocha head. Aroma of mild roast, chocolate, some restrained esters. Taste is vinous malt, dark chocolate sweetness, and a bit of charcoal. Mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth with soft carbonation. Mild aroma, but the taste and texture were certainly enjoyable.
",5
541,"Meh, I have to stop taking my account so seriously.  I need to rate the beers I drink, not just the good ones.  Thats not to say that this is a bad beer, just very, very bland.  	A rich, ashy aroma with creamy vanilla.  	The taste is also a bit ashy, bitter, some thin grainy flavor, and thats about it.  	Finish is thin and bitter, mostly due to carbonation issues and bittering hops that add nothing besides some remnant of a stout-like finish.
",1
542,"Courtesy of Degarth. Pours deep darkness with nice mocha head. The aroma is dark roasted malts, burnt malts, licorice, chocolate malts and a hint of toffee. The taste is fairly rich albeit a bit thin with roasted and burnt malts mixed with chocolate and licorice. I also get a pulse of oatmeal twang. The taste becomes more and more roasty and burnt into the finish. It has a full flavor that has a dry oatmeal twang to it.
",1
543,"Ok, definitely better oatmeal stouts out there.  I was little let down after having Barley Islands Java stout which was amazing.  Has a normal oatmeal stout flavor, but the aftertaste is rather metallic.
",1
544,"Courtesy of Degarth. Dark brown pour...tan head...low retention...some sheet lacing...felt like this one was more of a dry stout than a sweet stout...some sweetness in the aroma and flavor, but very drying on the palate and the finish...definitely better than their APA, which was almost undrinkable.
",1
545,"12 oz bottle thanks to tytoanderso.  Pours a brown black with a fizzy brown head.  Really roasty nose at first.  This mellows to more chocolate and sweet malts.  Fizzy carbonation, watery body.  Chocolate, roast, sweet oats in the flavor.  Finishes with burnt roasted malts.  The sweetness is counteracted nicely with the roast, but overall theres nothing too special.
",1
546,"UPDATED: FEB 28, 2008 Pretty good Oatmeal Stout. I would have this again for sure. Doesnt rate up with Sam Smiths and Milk Stout, but would fall in the next group below the elite (not a bad place to be). Not terrible thick, but not watery. Aroma is nice, again not too strong but not weak. Flavor is better than I expected. Nice and multi-dimensional. Nice mix of malt, oats, and grains in this one. Creamy and smooth. Tasty!
",5
547,"Sampled at ABR 07 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Pours an opaque dark brown brew with a thick tan head that has some good retention and lacing. Aroma of dark roasted oatmeal and black malt, a touch of coffee and some flowery hops. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonated with dark roasted malt and coffee flavors. Finish is semi-dry and bitter with a light coffee aftertaste. I prefer heavier textured stouts, this oatmeal stout is a little thin in flavor and thickness.
",5
548,"Im trying to get into stouts. Only problem is, I hate coffee. I tried this. Someone told me to break into stouts via an oatmeal, not a dry stout. So far, so good. I like it! Pours perfect black, with 2 finger creamy head. Smells of toffee, chocolate, and wonderful roasted malt. Nice. Tastes of toffee, chocolate, deep roasted malt & to my surprise, not much a coffee note. Its there, but blocked by the sweetness. I found my favorite oatmeal stout as of now, downed 2 bottles of it, and really enjoyed every drop. Nicely done guys!

550,"11-5-07 botle shared with lb4lb. 	Perfect black color with tan head and nice lacing.  Roasted chocolate flavor with a watery finish. Smooth, but not very creamy. I want it to be richer in smell and taste and I want the palate to have more depth and thickness.  Would drink again.  Enjoyable, it just doesnt knock you off your chair.
",5
551,"Thanks to Tytoanderso for the this bottle!		Pours a thick, oily black with a nice big tan head.  Smell is roasty dark malt, cream, and faint sweetness.  Touch too thin in the bodied for a stout, but the flavor is nice, and roasty.  Not burnt or overly done, and very drinkable.  Nice beer.
",1
552,"Thanks to Todd ( antzman ) from The KEG Liquors. Pours pretty much black with a small light tan head. Aroma is roasty, nutts, malts, light smoke. Flavor is very full for a low acl % stout. Bitter nutty malts and light smoke. Body is on the thin side but was still full of flavor.
",5
553,"ABR 2007.  A black pour with brown head.  The nose was a little light for on oatmeal stout, but the body was pretty solid oatmeal with fain coffee hints.
",5
554,"12 oz bottle, via Sephiroth.  Pours a clear black body under a fizzy one inch brown head that slowly faded leaving some heavy lacing.  The nose is very chocolaty and roasty with some light chalkiness and coffee.  The flavor is overly roasted to the point where its just too chalky and ashy with some light coffee and milk chocolate on the finish.  I dont get any oatmeal influence at all on either the flavor or body.  Mouthfeel is somewhat thin with a watery texture and moderate soft fizzy carbonation.  Quite a long lingering finish.  Overalll, this was just a ho-hum middle of the road Stout at best.
",1
555,"Bottled.  Poured deep ruddy brown with an explosive cap of deep tan head (Im talkin an inch of liquid and 5.5"" of head!).  The aroma picked up lightly-roasted semi-sweet chocolates, toasted oatmeal, and more charred black malts.. dusty overall with a bit of detergent character that detracted a bit.  The flavor had roasted sweeter chocolates and rolled oats with darker chocolates and coffee more toward the back.. coffee provided light-moderate bitterness, and carries through the short, but enjoyable finish.  Just a tad shy of medium-bodied with a creamy middle on the palate and nice balance.  This grew on me as the drink progressed.
",1
556,"(bottle) Pours black with a very small tan head.  Aroma consists of burnt malt and some coffee.  Taste is strong on roasted malt and slight coffee, with a nice smooth finish and lingering roast.  Not too bad, a little thin.

557,"[Bottle, thanks Guerde] Pours black with a small, dark tan head.  Aroma is roasted malt, coffee, brown sugar and oats.  Some malt and then quite a bit of coffee and some chocolate in the finish.  Far too thin.  Decent finish.  The mouthfeel killed this beer for me.
",5
558,"Bottle. Aroma of roasted malt. A hint of oatmeal cerealness. Fairly faint aroma. Pours black with a creamy khaki head. Flavor was lightly roasted malt. A hint of creamy sweetness. A tiny bit of coffee and chocolate (I think I stretching here). Creamy with good carbonation. Finishes a tad watery. Nothing spectacular here.
",1
559,"Had this beer on 9/19/2006.  Over carbonated, overflowed when I opened the bottle and could only get about an inch before it over foamed in the glass.  Aroma is mild with a scent of roasted malt.  Color is a deep black.  Taste is dry and toasted.  Starting with a medium body it goes down with a crisp roasted taste coming on and smooth feel.  Finish come is with a bright roasted flavor that turns to a bitter burnt taste and ends with a dry bitterness.  Even looking past the carbonation problem it still just isnt a good Oatmeal Stout.

561,"A solid, enjoyable oatmeal stout. Average tan, creamy head. Aroma filled with chocolate, coffee and toasted malts. Notes of molasses and vanilla.

Soft carbonation.

Aroma is sweet and milky with some roasty and chocolate notes detectable.  Flavor is milky/creamy, chocolatey, and smooth.  Some sugar and cream mixed with a bit of chocolate and coffee.  A nice, sessionable stout that was pretty good.

564,"From the bottle this pours a thick dark brown topped by a one-fingered brown head.  The aroma has bitter roasted malts with a splash of bittersweet chocolate and some soft nuts.  Fairly smooth drinking, it tastes pretty much as it smells, the bitterness increating slightly towards the finish.  Not bad.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp?

565,"12oz. bottle.  Aroma of faintly milky chocolate, creamy dark toffee and deeply roasted malts.  Dark brown-black color with a fine, subsiding head.  Roasty, bittersweet malt flavors dominate, with a blend of coffee, lightly charred grains, cocoa, a very light dried fruit character and a gently spicy hop character towards the drying, tangy finish.  Thin and smooth on the palate with a medium body.  Highly drinkable for the style.  Surprising that this is labeled a Winter seasonal.

568,"Fest sample. Pours a clear copper color with an average rocky off-white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate to heavy hop citrus aroma. Medium body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy bitter flavor with a good bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Very good brew.

569,"This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of foamy fine to medium sized off-white colored bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a transparent softly carbonated light orange brown colored body. The deep aroma was hoppy. The thin mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish hoppy aftertaste. The thin off the mark  flavor contained notes of hops. Not one that I would likely buy again.

Full well coated palate, lightly creamy.  Nice flavor lots of fruitty hops, passion fruit and orange rind, cereal, good sweetness.  I like it.

572,"Indiana Microbrewers Festival: Amber hued with a creamy small head. The aroma has notes of pineapple, mango, biscuity malts, and a hint of salt and minerals. The taste starts with acidic fruit and moderate bitterness. Light malt background leads to a metallic finish. Balanced true enough but also lacks the hop punch I expected. The mouth feel is sticky and lively, actually pretty refreshing for the size and nature of the beer. By the end I still was left wanting more from this beer but it appears that the keg at the fest is better that some people have had lately.
",1
573,"Snifter from the brewpub.  Gack.  The aroma is all jacked up with bad fermentation character.  The flavor was all screwed up too.  Hardly any hops.  It felt like it was sticking to my teeth when I drank it.  I left all but two drinks on the table.

574,"Growler from STFUN....I hate to do this but I have to bash this beer....Aroma was ok, hops smelled a little different for an DIPA. Taste was a thin syrup like medice taste. Just plain bad...I wasnt the only one who thought that. I shared it with four other people and they all said the same thing. Low carbonation. Over all a drain pour.... Which kind of upsets me since Josh worked so hard to get me this beer. Maybe it was a bad growler. I will have to re-rate if I ever go visit Indiana...Thanks Josh for going beyond the call of duty to get this beer for me!

575,"UPDATED: SEP 23, 2009 Solid all around. Pours a creamy orange, nice thing head, great lacing. Aroma is citrus, slightly metallic, with the ""funk"" that MI2CA mentioned. Flavor is mostly smooth, but with a great bitter bite that adds nicely. Lots of grapefruit in this one actually. Its a great addition to an IPA. The body is nice and thick, never too watery. A great balance of flavors going on too, nice malty notes with delicious citrus fruits dancing around. Not as strong as a Dreadnaught or 90min, but this has a lot of character to make up for it. This beer is awesome, I wish like hell theyd sell it in growlers (or bottle it).
",5
576,"Tulip at brewery - Hoppy aroma is earthy and a little funky, turns to play-doh after it warms.  Pours copper with a small head and great lacing.  Flavor is a nice blend of caramel and citrus hops.  Palate is smooth and not too tart and alcohol is well hidden.  I think they are using a different hop than your regular IIPA but I cant put my finger on it.  A nice one.

577,"12oz bottle-pours a dissipating brown head and black color.  Aroma is oak, vanilla, dark malt, raspberry.  Taste is oak, vanilla, dark malt-charcoal, raspberry, some hops bitterness.

578,"Very let down with this one. I really enjoy Brass Knuckles, and liked the Bourbon Aged Oatmeal Stout. But, this one? Not so much. Very strong bourbon all around, in the aroma, the flavor, everything. The dark berries take a backseat, and the oatmeal isnt really noticeable at all. Texture is rich and creamy, but the bourbon is just too much.
",5
579,"Cask at the brewery - I must first mention that I am not a fan of the non-raspberry version of this beer.  The aroma is initially roasted dark malts with raspberry notes that quickly fades into oak and bourbon.   Pours black with a brown ring head and good lacing.  Flavor is strong bourbon, roasted dark malts and chocolate with a hint of raspberry.  Cask provides a smooth and creamy finish.  Overall I think the bourbon is still too much and overpowers the subtleties of the raspberry and base brew.  But better than the non-raspberry.
",5
580,"Pint off the cask at BI - Aroma is mild toasted malts, caramel and a touch English hops.  Flavor is a bit stronger but pretty much the same as aroma.  Creamy and smooth palate.  Not a bad ale and better than Dirty Helen.
",5
581,"cask at the brewpub - The bartender assured me that this beer was not their regular bottled brown ale, but a new beer made for their cask.  It pours dark brown with minimal head.  The aroma is mostly caramel malt with a bit of dark fruit in there.  It tastes very sweet and full of caramel.  The dark fruit from the aroma is detectable.  Its medium bodied and has a very low carbonation level even for the cask.
",1
582,"Draft. Poured hazy brown color with an average fizzy off-white head that was mostly lasting with fair lacing. Moderate to heavy toasted malt, yeast and alcohol aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy complex sweet flavor with a medium to heavy bittersweet finish of moderate to long duration. My expectations where exceeded.

583,"Bottle shared by Dogbrick. Clear gold pour with a thin white head. Aroma of Belgian yeast, malt, banana and pepper. Banana dominates the flavor, which also consists of sweet malt and honey.

584,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2010 Sample at the Beer  Rock Band tasting on 08/27/2010: 2009 bottle. The beer is a clear golden color with a medium thin white head that dissipates quickly. Spotty lacing on the glass. Sweet biscuity malt and yeast aroma. Light body with flavors of yeast, bananas and malt. The finish is malt and yeast with a sweet aftertaste. A little above average overall.

585,"Pours golden with a fully receding white head. Notes of pear, bubble gum, honey, and pale malt. Medium bodied with soft carbonation. An enjoyable beer, despite the poor head retention.
",5
586,"This one seemed to be a little on the belgian ale side and less towards golden/blonde ale, but whatever. Nose was light with hints of grain, bread, dust, and a hint of yeast notes. Pours golden with a thin non lasting head and noticeable bubbles. Light grain, bread, dust, a touch of sweetness underneath, very light yeast esters. A little crispnes/drynesss in the finish, a hint of green apple perhaps too. A little Very easy drinking.

587,"This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a small sized head of finely sized clear colored bubbles that were quickly diminishing and left behind a transparent very softly carbonated light orange colored body. The mild aroma was malty and corn. The semi-thick mouth feel was tingly at the start with a mellow finish. The flavor contained notes of hops dough and wheat. An OK brew just nothing special.
",1
588,"Tap at BI, really love the idea, but the beer, eh, not so much.  Oak and vanilla nose, light alcohol and, unfortunately, green apple.  Leggy beige head, murky brown body.  Watery, with light bourbon and pale/amber, resolves to a bland bitterish/pale ale taste, forgettable and really without the best elements of the style, which no amount of aging in a Jack Daniels whiskey barrel will change.  In defense of the brewer, this may be an older sample; at the same time, if its being served on location, then there are quality control problems to be addressed (and possibly tap lines to be cleaned).

589,"Notes from Indy Winterfest		Pours light hazy straw-brown.	Aroma has sweetness and corn notes.  The flavor is butterscotchy, vanilla, and rather sweet.  Palate is normal.  Overall an ok beer, not one I would seek out.

590,"I am not a fan of Scotch Ales, but this was a nice one. Aroma is full of nuttiness and Jack Daniels, with a touch of smoke and toffee. Flavor is smooth, notes of vanilla, wood, toffee, roasted malt, with a hint of yeast. Lots of Jack Daniels flavor, but very little of the alcohol or booze, which was nice. Whiskey worked hand in hand with the wood to create a nice complexity. The carmel from the barrels balanced everything out nicely, and added a nice smokiness to the finish. Quite nice.
",5
591,"Tap at BI - Aroma is smokey toasted malts, caramel, toffee, peat and campfire.  Pours dark brown with a small lasting head and good lacing.  Flavor matches aroma.  Palate is dry and ashy.  I like the full bodied smokiness of this brew.  A lot better than their regular Scotch Ale (hint hint).
",5
592,"Released at BI Barrel Fest 11/23/2007  cask tulip - Aroma is soft bubblegum, spice, subtle oak, vanilla and yeasty bread.  Pours black with a small creamy off-white head and great lacing.  Flavor matches aroma with a stronger oak and vanilla finish.  Palate is dry, sticky but finishes smooth.  The barrel aging does not overpower the base beer.  A nice improvement on a good brew.   side-by-side with non-cask version - The extra carbonation brings out a bit more of the oakiness but loses the smooth finish.

598,"Bottle...beautiful looking beer upon pouring, dark black with a good sized tan head.  Nose has a load of roasted malts, coffee, dark brown sugar, vanilla, oak and some toasted coconut.  The bourbon is there but it is very subtle as previously noted in other reviews.  I love the mouth feel on this, very silky, well carbonated and not overly thick/heavy.  Flavor is dark roasted coffee, some vanilla extract, woodsy and again a bit of toasted coconut.  Overall I really enjoyed this for not being over-the-top in the bourbon department, it seems as though this whole bourbon aging thing has got a bit ridiculous and this is a nice change of pace.  Subtle but very nice brew.Earlier Rating: 5/24/2007 Total Score: 3.4Bottle pours a deep mahogany/cherry wood color with a minimal tan head.  Smells of some, believe it or not, chocolate-covered strawberries, malt, and some faint bourbon.  I know, chocolate-covered strawberries you say?  Surely I most be kidding, but I do not kid.  As a disclaimer I must say this is the first bourbon barrel-aged beer that Ive had and I sure did get smacked across the face with some bourbon on the finish.  Overall, this was a decent brew, a little thin with good flavor and a nice bourbon kick.

600,"Bottle from strykzone.  Thanks Dave.  Almost a black pour with a very small brown head.  Aroma is dark chocolate, molasses and maybe the faintest hints of bourbon.  Flavor is pretty roasty with notes of chocolate and a tiny hint of sourness. My only question is how long did they age this in bourbon barrels, 1 hour or 2 hours.  The bourbon flavor is so light and so faint you would never notice it if you didnt know what you were drinking. Still its a pretty good stout.

There are other smells fighting to make themselves present in the nose but the bourbon is just too dominant to let them show.	Tastes good. Theres a very good bourbon taste. There is some of the oatmeal stout coming through in the taste.	After letting it warm up a bit there is no change in the taste. Still dominated by the bourbon.	The mouthfeel is smooth with just a slight bit of carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer. I enjoy bourbon aged beers so I really enjoying this one. I just wish there was a secondary taste that showed up. If there was a noticeable chocolate or coffee taste then this would be a very solid stout.	This is a good stout. Appreciate the opportunity to drink it.

607,"Bomber.  Pours an extremely dark mahogany brown to virtually black color.  A frothy, dark khaki colored head settles slowly to a thin layer with a prominent edge.  Random spotting marks the glass.  Aromas include burnt caramel, chocolate fudge, mocha, vanilla, and faint hints of bourbon.  It is mostly sweet smelling, with traces of earthy hops lending just a hint of bitterness.  The bourbon is very subtle, almost unnoticeable at first, eventually folding into the brew quite nicely.  Flavors follow suit, sweet cocoa and scorched caramel leading the charge, with oaky vanilla, earthy spice, and traces of sour mash bourbon to follow.  The mouthfeel is medium-full and somewhat syrupy, its substance coming mostly from the sugar profile.  Still, it never gets cloying or overly sticky.  This is not a bad brew at all.  Its a pretty solid stout, although a bit too sweet perhaps, that has been subtly kissed by the oak bourbon barrel.

612,"2008 Bottle from West Lakeview.   Pours a thicker near black with a small soda-like tan head.   Big crass aroma of bourbon, chocolate and coffee grinds with notes of vanilla and leather/dirt.    Flavor is actually pretty smooth, bourbon forward but has balanced supporting notes of chocolate, light roasted coffee, burnt molasses, touch of raisin, oats and creamy vanilla.  Quite earthy, especially the aroma.  Very fluffy but fine and smooth carbonation, medium body with a full mouthful.   This is like the standard brewpub bourbon-barrel stout, good but generic.

Poured a clear, deeper brown with a cool swirly dusting of deep beige head and what appeared to be legs running down the sides of the glass.  The aroma definitely focused on the barrel aspect, with sweet vanilla, bourbon, and lightly-charred oak representin... although none of these characteristics were abrasive, and the underlying stout was quite nice with medium-roasted chocolate and mild lactic notes.  The flavor had nice roasty chocolate again at the core with some sweet oats.. barrel accent was very well executed with vanilla bean and bourbon accents.. finish was somewhat long, beginning with roasted bakers chocolate and transitioning to sweet bourbon, oak char, and mild lactic sourness.  About medium-bodied on the palate with higher carbonation (a touch too high.. filling up the mouth too rapidly).  All in all a very good beer!

623,"UPDATED: JUL 27, 2009 12/06/2007 and 8/13/2008:  Barley Islands Bourbon Barrel-Aged Oatmeal Stout Tavern Style Ale has a good aroma of vanilla, roasted malts, hints of licorice, and some dark fruits and smoke.  The color of the beer is nearly black and is has a small frothy tan-colored head.  The flavor is really smooth and mellow as the vanilla, roasted and caramelized malts, chocolate, and slightly dry bourbon and charred wood mend together.  This beer has a medium to medium-full body and is quite smooth with a bit of a creamy texture.  This particular bottle is much better than the first one I had.  That one was really bland and unexciting.  This one really has some barrel aged aromas and flavors as the vanilla and some slight bourbon notes are definitely noticeable.  This beer isnt stellar, but it is still quite tasty for being a barrel-aged oatmeal stout.  It is really well-balanced and although it might not be high in alcohol, it is still a good deal at only $4.49+tax per bomber!  This is a solid sessionable barrel-aged oatmeal stout (first one?) at that price and probably the cheapest ""barrel-aged"" beer available!	22 fl. oz. bottles from Westside Wine and Liquors in West Harrison, Ohio.

The aroma has barrel wood notes, sweet bourbon and mild chocolate to go along with roasty notes and faint oxidation in the background. Delicious flavor with creamy mouthfeel ushering in sweet mildly roasted malts, rich chocolate and wood notes. I get a mildly building bourbon sensation and an oatmeal twang in the back. It seems to thin out just a bit into the finish. Tasty.

628,"Bottle shared by EDA. Too much bourbon for a beer like this. Kind of oaty, lots of bourbon aroma. Vegetal, chalky, more bourbon flavor. A bit wheaty. Flavor isnt too bad.

629,"Bottle courtesy Degarth. Pours black with a small tan head. Aroma of bourbon, roasted malt, and licorice. Taste is the same as aroma. Medium mouthfeel with a mild to moderate amount of bitterness. Very good.

630,"22 oz. Bomber: Pours a coffee black with a dark medium tan head that diminishes to the side of my glass rather quickly. This brew lives up to its name since the bourbon comes out in the aroma and flavor. Sweet aroma also has hints of oatmeal, dark chocolate, and dried fruit. Bourbon flavor finishes with a mild dry bitterness. Just like drinking bourbon straight, this is a good sipping pastime. This is one of the better bourbon stouts that I have had. Well Done!

634,"22oz bottle, courtesy of a trade from a while ago.  Thanks!  Pours a very dark chocolate brown color; huge, textured, medium tan head with great retention and fine-bubbled, glistening lacing; a beautiful pour.  Smells like lightly toasted oak, vanilla extract, and lots of slightly warming bourbon in the aroma; the sweet vanilla can seem a bit much, and the bourbon comes on strong at first.  Medium mouthfeel: loads of warming bourbon, milk chocolate, and toasty oak and vanilla; the bourbon and oakiness is a bit beyond the chocolatey, light stout underneath; but theres really nothing overly harsh or astringent here, surprisingly; a warming, reasonably tasty milk chocolate stout.  Medium finish, toasty oak, vanilla, soft bourbon and wood, with plenty of chocolate.

635,"I couldnt tell a big difference between the regular and the oaked aged brew.  The oak age perhaps is a little more robust with and smooth with the flavor.  It is a solid oatmeal stout, but has a certain spice on the after taste.  Barely Island Java Stout is a lot better.

636,"Bottle from the Keg - Pours black with a mostly receding tan head. Aroma of bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, and foamy roast. Tastes of bourbon, alcohol, vanilla, oak, spice, and chocolate. Mouhtfeel is full bodied with foamy carbonation. Similar to eating bourbon chocolates. Enjoyable, but maybe a bit too long in the barrels.
",1
637,"Bottle. Thanks to Sprinkle for sending me this. Poured a deep black body with thin head that faded quick. Aroma is chocolate, vanilla, light oats. Flavor is very strong bourbon, vanilla, light chocolate. The bourbon really came on too strong many times while drinking this beer and hurt the other flavors.
",5
638,"bottle (22 oz thanks to sprinkle).....a thin very dark brown pour witha beige colored head....the nose was made up of chocolate, molasses, and not too much in the way of being aged in whiskey barrels. a touch of vanilla....flavors of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, very subtle vanilla and pretty thin overall.  wish the barrel aging showed up a little more.

639,"Bottle (22 oz).  Bourbon and oatmeal raisin cookie aroma.  Midnight black with a thin tan head.  Chocolate and oat malt flavor with just a hint of bourbon.  Much lighter body than expected.  Nice taste but pretty light.

640,"22oz bottles acquired in trades with atpayne & Sephiroth (thanks!). Poured a dark black color with brown edges and a larger sized tan head.

Il go against the grain on this one as I really enjoyed it.

641,"Thanks to hopdog.  Pours a deep black with a smaller bubbly deep tan head that left some slight lacing.  Aroma of bourbon, oak, vanilla, some chocolate, roasted malts and light chocolate.  Flavor of roasted malts, oats, bourbon, vanilla and a touch of coffee.  Barrel aging done very nicely.

644,"Draft @ S. Indiana Brewery & Winery Fest: Jet black pour with a frothy tan head.  Lots of boozy bourbon and vanillan oak in the nose.  The body offers a more rounded chocolate and marshmellow notes.  The finish ends boozy as well.  This is a fresh batch to be released in bombers in November.  Il have to grab a fresh bottle to lay down for a while because this could really sing with some age on it.
",1
645,"Expected more from this.  Poured nearly opaque black with an ample frothy brown head.  Slight note of vanilla, wisp of bourbon, touch of oak.  Nothing intense.  Very subtle.  Stouts should not be subtle.  Especially bourbon barrel-aged ones.  Also, too much carbonation and too light in the body.  The flavor was weak notes of bourbon, coffee, chocolate.  Disappointing.
",1
646,"Served on cask at brewpub. Pours a very dark black with a minimal dark tan head. Aroma is bourbon and coffee. Very strong bourbon aroma. Taste is like a Kentucky Breakfast Stout with a lot more coffee and a lot more bourbon. No subtelty here. Tasted more like a hard alcohol drink than a beer. ABV must be extraordinary. Not very drinkable due to huge ABV. If you love coffee and bourbon, this one is for you, but it certainly isnt for the feint of heart.
",5
647,"22 oz bottle, vis nolankowal.  Pours a deep black colored body under a one inch brown head that gained density as it sat, ending in a tight bubbled foamy cream.  Aroma is very roasty with just the lightest accents of vanilla and bourbon.  Some chocolate fudgecake, and a little chalk.  The flavor is pretty thin with a mix of chalky roast, vanilla extract, and a light lactic tinge.  Very, very, light barrel influence.  Mouthfeel is on the thinner side with an almost nitrogenated carbonation feel to it.  A little bit of sweet stickiness on the finish.  Overall, just a little bit too thin all around, and lacking in complexity.

648,"Bottle (650ml) shared at Biegamans Summer Gathering -- my bottle courtesy of lewis13. Pours black with ruby hues and an average size somewhat-lasting light-brown head. Aroma of bourbon (but thankfully not too much) along with chocolate, some roastness, oats and oak. The bourbons even more subtle in the flavour which is nice (thats how it should be!) along with sweet malt, chocolate, oak, some hops and a mild bitter finish. Medium bodied. This is bourbon barrel-aged done right, its not overpowering. I really enjoyed it.

649,"22oz. Bottle	$4.99	Big Red Bloomington		Poured the darkest brown body you could imagine. So close to black its hard to tell the difference. A 1+ finger chocolate head formed on the pour that quickly faded to a whispy cap with thick edges. Leaves sticky thin drink lines with each sip that slowly fall back into the body. This beer looks good but menecing at the same time.		The aroma starts off with a solid base of malt. Coffee beans and bittersweet chocolate are both present and very enjoyable. A perfect blend of vanilla bean, some musty wood, and mild bourbon come in flashes over the malts. This is a wonderful warm smelling beer.		The flavor is all in the aroma. The chocolate maltiness starts things off and is quickly followed by coffee beans at mid-palate. The coffee beans follow through to the finish and are accompanied by lightly roasted grains. The vanilla and mild bourbon leave a very pleasant coating that lasts a few seconds after the swallow. Leaves a mildly bitter coffee aftertaste.		Medium body with a nice creaminess from the barrel aging. Sluggish carbonation lets the beer work through at its own pace. 		This is definately a highly drinkable beer. Very enjoyable and not heavy like most of the barrel aged stouts you run into. Lower abv lets you enjoy a few glasses without being too much.		This beer is a huge surprise. I saw the average score before I reviewed and after sampling this bottle I really cant understand why its so low. This is a wonderful beer. If its retired I hope they plan to bring it back at some point. Really well made beer.		Notes: I read through some other reviews after I wrote this one. Many said the bourbon was way too strong. I sat on this bottle for probably 4-5 months.		3/3/07
",5
650,"Pours black with a fair tan head that stays well. Aromas of oak, slight bourbon, some chocolate, and a little vanilla.  Flavor is oak, bourbon, chocolate, roasted malts, and some vanilla. Really not bad flavor at all but what takes away is the over carbonated palate with thin body..  A little more malt and this one might be worthwhile..

652,"Dark brown body with a medium tan head.  Original beer with a surprisingly wide range of flavours.  Lots of dark malts with a black liquorice and chocolaty flavour, then some kind of oak juice join in providing a nice sourness taste and all that is followed by some limy hops leaving the taste-buds a pleasant tartness.  I very much liked this beer, a lot more so than anybody here it seems.  Noblesvilles noble beer.
",5
653,"My Bottom Line:	This competent sweet stout is strongly influenced by its vanilla-laced bourbon, yet it never exaggerates as its barrel-aging and malty molasses sharply dip into drying roastiness. 		Further Personal Perceptions:	-The fast-depleting head is barely noticed if you are staring into the deep darkness.	-The carbonation is rather frothy for the style, nearly recalling Belgian-style effervescence.	-Licorice and dark chocolate appear within the bourbon-made vanilla.		Bottle; no date.

654,"22 oz extra in a trade with Sprinkle.  Not a lot of bourbon, but some wood in the aroma.  More wood in the flavor, Some dark roasty notes as well.  Not too bad.

655,"22ozer from Khans on Keystone. Pours a clear brown with  abit of tan foamy head. Nose is dominated by the barrel aging giving it a one-sided aroma. It was nice tho as there were some underlying notes of toffee and chocolate just not upfront and personal.
",5
656,"Bomber shared with muenster and NachlamSie. Pours black with amber extremities and a big tan head. The aroma is coffee, raisins, whisky, and hints of alcohol, caramel, and toffee. The flavor is dominated by interesting coffee notes, with some distant bitter chocolate. Some smoky bourbon notes come out once in a while, but not too often (as seems to frequently be the case with barrel aged stuff). The aftertaste is quite warm. Grainy oat flavor is apparent at times, too, though not as smoothly as other oatmeal stouts. Pretty good in all.
",5
657,"Bottle split with Muenster, Tronraner. A nice dark chocolate-colored pour into our glasses reveals a very heady brew. The aroma obviously has bourbon and a chocolate nut bar. The oats are very much noticed. In the mouth bourbon is easily noticed, but it doesnt overwhelm or interrupt the other flavors of the stout. Rather, it melds well with the chocolate/coffee flavors not to mention the dense toasted oats. The finish reminds me of a Girl Scout Samoa cookie, just imagine it not being sweet. This makes a great sipper with a medium-heavy palate and very assertive flavors.
",5
658,"Bomber, thanks NachlamSie. Pours dark black/brown/ruby with a massive dark tan head. The aroma was very nice, strong on the bourbon, with notes of coffee, and chocolate. I didnt detect any oatmeal in the aroma, but the flavor was bursting with sweet oats, coffee, and bourbon, and wood. Very nice.

659,"22 oz bomber-very dark brown with a huge beige head which resembles oxidization-fizzy and very small bubbles.  very oxidized nose no borubon left in the nose at all.  toasted and chared cardboard flavors.  man this is bad.  3 sips was enough.  drain pour!

660,"Solid black body.  Nose is a slightly woody burbon.  Flavour is slightly burnt malts (black patent) with some chocolate flavours and a light burbon.
",5
661,"Bottle. Opaque body with a thin film of bubbles. Nose-butter, bourbon, smoke, char. Taste-char, burnt coffee, acrid char (in a good way). The char overwhelms all of the other flavors.
",5
662,"Opaque, black with a thick, overcarbed, chunky, light brown head.  Very nice vanilla and oak aroma coupled with a soft oatmeal, a warm, yeast fruit, and charcoal.  Carbonation and bitterness are overdone but underneath all of the aroma components are there with the roast creating a long, dry finish but also a hint of soy sauce.
",1
663,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2006 22 oz bottle - Pours very dark brown with a big, enduring head.  It has a heavy bourbon aroma.  The flavor is dry roasted malts and quite a bit of bourbon.  Theres a moderate body with okay carbonation.  The finish is unremarkable.  It loses something overall.  I thought the bourbon dominated too much, not because there was too much bourbon necessarily, but rather because there wasnt enough else going on.  Its alright, but drinking my way through the whole bomber I got tired of it.
",1
664,"Bottle: Dark brown to black pour, monster head. It took quite a while to fit this 22oz into a liter mug. Aroma smelled a little too much like sawdust and cheap booze. Flavor wasnt much better, some roastiness, and bourbon, but at least this didnt finish like licking a 2X4 the way their BA porter did.
",1
665,"Bottle shared by IMtheOptimator.  Pretty ample light brown head with a thick brown body.  Aroma of frash grains and some brown sugar and molasses.  First impression is this is over-carbonated.  It leaves me feeling like Im drinking foam, not liquid, so its hard to even get to the flavor.  After a few minutes the flavors start to come out.  That graininess sticks around from the aroma, in both the palate and the flavor.  The brown sugar is there as well, coming along with a distinct bourbon note at times.  Coffee.  Tasty, but not my fav.
",1
666,"Bottle shared by IMtheOptimator.  Sweet, chocolate and coffee aroma with some vinousness and a bit of bourbon in the background.  Mostly opaque dark dark brown color with a HUGE tan head.  Very carbonated, bubbly and roasted coffee flavors to start with some sweet sugary notes to follow.  The bourbon makes some mild cameo appearances in the background.  This has just the right amount of barrel flavor.  This beer is too carbonated, though.
",1
667,"Bottle courtesy of secret santa.  Poured almost completely opaque black with a large frothy brown head.  Aroma of grapes and some light coffee.  Taste is some watered down coffee with a bit of buttery bourbon in the finish. Very fizzy body.
",1
668,"Thanks JCapriotti!  The beer pours to a dark brown body with a thin tan head.  The aroma is pretty nice.  Raw barley grain thats been balanced by light bourbon and vanilla.  The flavor is bourbon, sweet stout, very light and kinda boring.  Thin boring mouthfeel.
",1
669,"Dark brown body; creamy ring of a brown head. Odd aroma... green, leafy whiskey or something, along with some dry, roasty malt. Interesting aroma... not too sweet or malty. Raw, woody whiskey and dry roasted malt with some light hop hints; maybe some grass. Not meant to be aged in barrels... and/or just not aged properly.
",1
670,"Bottle courtesty of Jasons dad.  Clear black body under a small dark tan head.  Cherries, whiskey, and black roast in the aroma.  Nothing too sweet but its intriguing.  The flavor just sucks - its a thin, dry oatmeal stout overridden by cheap-tasting whiskey.  A big letdown.
",1
671,"Has a pretty nice oatmeal and chocolate aroma.  Nice black color with a little brown head.  Has a coffee flavor, slightly bitter, although it seems a little off somehow.  Nice body and carbonation.    Overall, its OK, but nothing I would seek out in the future.
",1
672,"Near black colour with a big head.  Quite fizzy, obscuring some chocolatey accents.  Mainly malty with light chocolate but I cant move past the fizz (I never can).
",1
673,"Pours pitch black and completely opaque with a two finger frothy beige head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. Spotty lacing left behind. 		Roasted malt aroma with a tamer barrel presence than expected. Slight toasted oak and vanilla notes with only subtle bourbon presence. Roasted malts with hints of chocolate, caramel and toffee.		Medium bodied and similar to the aroma. The barrel presence is there but pretty faint with only slight earthy oak and sweet bourbon flavor. The base beer flavor is very strong with roasted malt, coffee, toast, toffee and hazelnut. Slight lactic creaminess smother things out a bit before ending with a slight dry finish.

674,"Bottle shared by smittymack poured a clear dark brown with a small lasting brown head. Aromas of bourbon, burnt carmel, vanilla, dark fruit and molasses. Palate was light to medium bodied and smooth. Flavors of bourbon, burnt carmel, vanilla, dark chocolate and light oak with a smooth lingering chocolate finish.

675,"Bottle. Pours jet black with a small brown head. Aroma of roasted malts, coffee, vanilla, chocolate and faint bourbon. Flavor was medium bodied and creamy with bitter chocolate, roasted coffee, vanilla, oak, roasted malts and bourbon.

676,"12oz bottle via trade.  Very dark brown in color with a one-finger whiteh head that lasts and leaves some lacing.  The aroma is pretty nice, with HUGE bourbon, backed up by ashy roast and coffee.  The flavor is all right, but WAY too big on bourbon.  That dominates the flavor, and a dry and ashy espressoish stout hides behind it.  Medium-bodied with a rather dry mouthfeel, and a bit boozy for 6%, from all the bourbon I guess.  Overall, a bit unbalanced.  If they were able to fine-tune the -bal aging though, I could see this being pretty good.
",1
677,"Bottle Pitch black ale with a mid-sized, creamy, beige head. Fantastic retention. The aroma awards my senses with rich notes of toasted nuts, vanilla and bourbon. Full-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and raspy carbonation. The flavor leans toward the bitter side of balance, but also offers moderately sweet vanilla, chocolate and coconut. Fairly bitter alcohol and charcoal finish. Bottle courtesy of MI2CA!
",5
678,"12 oz. bottle from West Lakeview Liquors.  Pours an opaque dark brown color with a small tan head that leaves a ring on the inner edge and a film atop the beer.  Aroma of bourbon, vanilla, oak, roasted malts, plums, oats, and rye.  Flavor of roasted malts, copper, vanilla, plums, smoked oak, coffee, and a little bourbon.  Medium-bodied, with a roasty mouthfeel and medium carbonation.  Lingering finish of deep, bitter roast and with some ash as well.  This hit the spot tonight, a very nice, simple, solid barrel aged stout.

679,"Bottled. A black beer with a lazing tan head. The aroma has notes of sweet matl as well as lighter notes of roasted malt. The flavor is sweet malty with light notes of roasted malt, leading to a dry roasted finish.
",1
680,"Served from a 12 oz bottle from Crown in Indy. The appearance is a rich chocolate brown with a medium frothy medium brown head. The aromas are mild with oatmeal, oak, and whiskey. The flavors are grainy with oatmeal and rye forward and whiskey in the after taste. The oak flavors have a rawness to them and dirty tone (not negatives) and a spice. Some wet coffee grinds too. The mouth is medium to full bodied with a tighter fizzier carbonation. I got to say this one grew on my quite nicely. A touch mellow but raw and tasty.
",5
681,"Thanks to Oakes for sharing this bottle.  Thick brown head over a pitch black beer.  Sweet chocolate/vanilla aroma with some definite oaty type of aroma.  Flavour seems a bit hot (especially considering its only 4.9%).  Lots of oakiness but with less vanilla than woodiness.  Woody complexity in the flavour but comes across with a bit of astringency as well.  Slightly overcarbonated as well.  Not bad, but definitely not great.
",1
682,"Draft.  Pours black with a thin tan head.  Aroma is very strong and astringent, mostly that of bourbon.  Smells like window cleaner.  Flavor is way too strong of bourbon in my opinion.  Very hot!  Palate is way too thin and watery.  a disappointment.
",1
683,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2007 22 oz bomber.  Being a Buffalo Trace bourbon fan, I was looking forward to trying this one.  The nose is all bourbon, almost like you have a shot of bourbon in your hand.  The first sip is very strong with the oak and bourbon from the barrels, with a mild, smooth aftertaste.  A little one dimensional for this style, but very drinkable.
",5
684,"Bottle - a fairly strong bourbon aroma what gives way gradually to some chocolate as it warms.  Black body with a huge near medium-brown head.  It really is overcarbonated.  It took 4 series of pouring and waiting for the head to subside to get 3/4s of a glass.  The flavor is kind of odd.  Some swallows the bourbon is up front and others it is in the finish.  I dont know that Ive experienced that before.  There is some chocolate in there, as well.  Fairly thin for the style and lacking the creaminess that is typical for an Oatmeal Stout.  Interesting as most bourbon-aged beers are.  Another rater said that it is too small for the bourbon and that may be true.  Hopefully theyll stick with it and tweak it.  Shows promise.
",1
685,"UPDATED: JAN 7, 2006 Very obvious bourbon taste in the middle and end of this beer.  A little bitter in my opinion. Seems to finish good. Not alot of aftertaste. Have tried 2 Oatmeal stouts so far. Have not liked either one very much. Drinkable beer. Just not one of my favorites.

687,"I had a nighmare about this stuff. I wanted to have no mention of it ever again, but I needed to just vent. Pours clear dark brown and foamy. Nose is all bourbon, maybe some vanilla, oak.

688,"2005 bottle shared with SuIIy on 11/23/05.  The bottle says it is unfiltered and unpasteurized, but yet, the beer pours the most fizzy, clear thing I have seen lately.  If this isnt forced carbonation, than its the strangest natural carbonation Ive ever experienced.  Deep cola brown, somewhat dull, not much in the auburn-red tinged department, as some deeper colored stouts have.  Tan-beige head is mountainous and very very slow to recede.  Lacing present.  Aroma of straight bourbon, dry and lightly alcoholic, with light vanilla and very dry wood.  Hints of bakers chocolate, some light yeast and very little else.  No sweet malt, no creamy oat-like notes, no hops.  Flavor is full bourbon.  Hints of peanut skins, salt, seltzer water and alcohol.  Pure bourbon, dry wood and light roast.  Its not that the bourbon is overdone here, its just that the beer is underdone.  No malt sugars, little if any chocolate or roast.  Body seems very filtered, though they say it is not.  Carbonation is omnipresent, sharp, obtrusive and very high.  Texture is watery, loose, prickly and thin on end.  As it warms, the aroma takes on a note of glue or hot plastic.
",1
689,"22oz bottle from ATPayne. First off, I would love to try this side by side with a non BA version. Since I cant, I will simply give a description of this version. Pours a nice black color with a foamy brown head. Seems very fizzy and carbonated. Nose is mainly bourbon with a slight bit of chocolate seeping through. Flavor is all bourbon, a little bit woody and some more bourbon. Lacking here, nothing good happening and the bourbon has taken this beer hostage. No solid stout characteristics remain and its like drinking a carbonated glass of watered down bourbon. BA is not always successful.
",1
690,"Bottle.  Medium dark brown opaque pour.    Weak bourbon aroma, with some alcohol and maybe a woody/earthy hint.  Medium roasty malt flavors, with bourbon and chocolate.  Way too carbonated and not at all oatmeal-stout-creamy.  A little thin too.
",1
691,"Poured black with a huge tan head.  Aroma of roasted malt with the bourbon running underneath.  As opposed to the porter which had the bourbon on top.  Flavor of roasted malt with a touch of bourbon.  Smooth mouth feel but not as creamy as I thought it would be for an oatmeal stout.
",1
692,"Totally opaque pour with a massive, long lasting tan head - aroma of bourbon, vanilla, oak, alcohol - a bit thin on the palate - not many oatmeal stout characteristics besides a hint of lactose - mostly, the wood and bourbon from the barrel overpower whatever other flavors the beer has - if you want a similar experience, soak a tongue depressor in whiskey and suck on it.
",1
693,"Something must have been wrong with this bottle!!!  Large head that quickly fades to nothing over a black body.  Thick and oily.  Cocoa, caramel and malty nose, quite mild.  Flavor is biting:  bitter, like unsweetened cocoa and very difficult to enjoy.  Sour finish and my mouth is left feeling dry.  No complexities or unique flavors.  It tastes very much like finished wood.
",1
694,"Atpayn is the rater that sent me this set of Barrel Aged Brews!  		 Ink black body with the most ridiculously oversized tan head (like Freds brother) that my have ever been seen by man or beast! I think. Well I know I let this beer cellar for too long by the secondary fermentation that took place in the bottle, hence the massive head (Freds brother) I have this problem with Shipyards Bluefin Stout. Its unfiltered, and once the beer warms to about 70F it starts a secondary and becomes over carbonated. 	 Nevertheless, the aging must have toned down the bourbon presence; although it is still dominate. The flavor has rounded very nicely. Massive notes of toasted oak, vanilla, hazelnut, chocolate, coffee, and bourbon duhhhh! Downside the palate is feeble; thin and lacking punch.  If it were more full bodied this beer would rock the block, no doubt.  A great effort overall!
",5
695,"Bottle served in a Expedition glassware:	Pours a deep brown hue with ruby highlights around the edges topped by a frothy tan head and good lace. The aroma has notes of mocha, oats, caramel,  smoke, dusty yeast, floral hops, and a hint of bourbon esters. The taste starts malty sweet with noticeable oat and chocolate overtones before leading towards a vanilla and oaky midesection. The finish is bitter mostly from dark malts and sublime hopping. The feel is quite lively and aggressive, a tad overcarbonated and thin. Needs more oatmeal for body. Overall, I liked it but could see how others may be disappointed. The barrel aging is upfront and the feel is weak. With some tweeking, this beer could rock. I have only the one bottle but would pick up another or two for a rerate and trade if I can find it.

696,"black, off white head.  toasty toffee-ish bourbon aroma with some chocolate.  flavour is sweet and boozy, but the body seems thin for the style and the barrel aging.  finishes roasty and mildly tart.

697,"The bourbon aromas were obvious and dynamic. Sweet chocolate and roastiness too - very nice aroma. Standard stout appearance leads to a slightly overpowering whisky flavoured beer. It finished fairly smoothly but I found it too thin and unbalanced to score high.

701,"Rich dark appearance with a huge frothy chocolaty head. Mild aroma of sweet malts and lightly hoppy. Flavor is quite sweet, rather chocolaty with strong carmel tones, very thick, somewhat chalky, and a little bit sour, that detracts from it. Decent but far from great.

702,"Aroma of alcohol, coffee and dark chocolate. Dark as night, small toffee head. Tastes of pitfruits, bitter and medium bodied. A fine and interesting treat! Thanks to qdog.

703,"Big thanks to TAR for this one!  22 oz bomber acquired in a trade!  Impressive lasting chocolate brown head on a dark chocolate brown body.  First whiff is watered down whiskey/bourbon.  Beyond that its chocolate, light roasty malt with a very, very subdued raisiny dark fruit character.  Toasted oatmeal when it warms along with oak woody notes and hints of vanilla.  Very smooth complex aroma IMHO!  Well balanced flavor with roasty & vanilla flavor; Chocolate & caramel  with resiny hop. Whiskey in the finish & aftertaste, but more subtle than the aroma.  finish is on the malty sweet side.  Minimal fruitiness.  Medium high carbonation...way too much for the type of beer that this is.  A little dry in the mouth, very thin, probably due to over carbonation.  A little thin in the mouth, but overall I think a very fine beer!  Great nose, above average palate, but the body killed the overall experience for me.

704,"Black with a ruby tinge, and a dark tan head. Big aroma of bourbon and malt with some roasty edges. Thin body and poorly balanced flavour, like a weak stout topped with a shot of sweet whiskey. A real let-down, especially after it smelled so good...  [Toronto Christmas Party 04]

705,"Quite a long name. Poured deep and dark black, brown head. Whiskey aroma along with some sweeter malts and a bit of roast. Dominant bourbon flavor, roast is an afterthought. Medium bodied. It wasnt that bad but I think the barrel aging would have fared better with a bigger beer.

706,"UPDATED: JUN 7, 2007 Bottle (650ml) shared at Biegamans Summer Gathering courtesy of blankboy.  Black, small bubbly tan head.  Sweet bourbon alcohol aroma.  Nice taste - dry oatmeal, bourbon - nice mix, not overpowering.  Oak, chocolate as well, agreed with blankboy, this one achieves a nice balance.  Compared to the very small sample I had two and half years ago - I really enjoyed it!				Original rating:  small sample at Dougs Dec 04! 6/4/4/2/11 Bottle @ Dougs.  Strong whiskey aroma, pitch black body.  Big tan head.  Good solid stout body and mouthfeel, but I did not like the mix of whiskey and beer flavours together - completely unbalanced.  Seems like a novelty act to me, not really enjoyable in the end.  Big thanks to those who brought it though, I appreciate the chance to try it.

707,"Creamy proud crown to this stout. Very presentable. Woody, sulphury, malt and hop accented aroma. Fine at front, medium bodied. Decent but somewhere falls apart.

708,"Very dark brown w/ light brown foam. Robust, roasty flavour of chocolate, coffee, oak, whiskey, vanilla & cherry(?). Medium-full, creamy feel. Nice roasty, malty flavour of chocolate, coffee, oak, vanilla & whiskey w/ burnt undertones.

709,"Thanks to whoever brought this to the Toronto Christmas Party 04.  Smells like Jack Daniels.  Very alcoholic/astringent nose.  Strongly bitter but with some milky coffee.  The flavors imparted by the barrel is overwhelming.

710,"Pitch black body with a chocolate coloured head. Strongly alcoholic aroma  with notes of sweet dark fruit and bourbon. Flavour is highly alcoholic covering up the vauge notes of malt and chocolate underneath. Rough, and fairly thin bodied. Disappointing for my first barrel aged beer but am very glad I got to try it. Many thanks to Wohlfs and Qdog for bringing this to the Toronto Christmas Party 2004.

711,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2008 Bottle acquired in trade with Atpayne (thanks Adam). Slick black color and a light brown head. Taste is of mellow oak, vanilla, milk chocolate and roasted malts. Oatmeal is hardly noticeable. Mouthfeel is smooth and almost full bodied. Bourbon flavor is more in the finish along with mellow bitterness. A freakin well done beer.

712,"Sweet vanilla porter.  Bitter and sour.  Slightly creamy flavors -- melted ice cream.  Tasted like too much vanilla extract -- fake, overly sweet, and artificial.

713,"Has some over carbonation issues with the pour, but settles down to a nice opaque black with a rich dark tan head.  Has a pleasant subtle dry roasty malt aroma with plenty of bourbon character to back it up.  Starts with a light sweetness and caramel maltiness with some hints of dark chocolate, vanilla and coffee toward the finish.  Could use some more body, but has nice bourbon complexity and flavor throughout.  Pretty dry for a sweet stout though.  Many thanks to atpayne for this brew!
",5
714,"Bottle pours black as night, large foamy brown head, with super sticky lacing.  Heavy, sweet aroma of bourbon and vanilla.  Seems very similar to the Bourbon Barrel Porter aroma.  Flavor, to me at least, doesnt seem to be as robust as the porter tho.  Burnt malts, light bourbon, and slight vanilla notes on the tongue  Okay body, medium mouthfeel.  Finishes with some bourbon imparted oak flavor with hints of vanilla.  Doesnt seem heavy enough, albeit quite clean.  I believe I prefer the Porter to this one.  Thanks goes out to atpayne for the trade!

715,"On tap at Mad Anthonys Octobeer Fest.  I had several samples of this, hoping to get more out of it given what Id heard of it.  Some guy said that this beer varies greatly by batch, and I must have gotten one of the weak batches.  Dark beer with a creamy brown head.  Almost smokey burnt wood nose.  Very subtle bourbon barrel flavors.  Almost honey sweetness with raw oak woodiness.  Much lighter in body than I expected.

716,"Tap @ Mad Anthonys.  Deep opaque.  Little to no head.  Bourbon notes in aroma.  Thin body.  Roasted malt taste, with bourbon flavors at first taste.

717,"I like this beer a lot. Perfect pour.  Smells good, and taste great with no aftertaste.  could be a little more bold for my taste, but other then that, a damn good beer.

718,"Festival tap: Black with some tan head. Sour nose with underlying wood and coffee.  Sour cherry and syrup taste was balanced by vanilla and creamy chocolate, all the while retaining the woody dryness. Alcohol completely masked.  Bitter at the finish with sour berry aftertaste. More vanilla.
",5
719,"A big thanks to TAR for letting me try this beer...his kindness is exceeded only by the size of his gut :) .... This beer pours black in color with a slightly creamy orange head which lasted nicely. The aroma is vanilla, oak, cocoa, coffee, tree twigs, and heavy black currants. Complex and sweet aroma...very nice. The taste is very oaty, bready and earthy, with chocolate, vanilla, milkiness, heavy bourbon, wood, tree twigs, and cotton candy. Once again, an incredibly complex taste for such an unheard of beer. Dry roasty finish, some sweet vanilla and brown sugar...great mouhtfeel. Very nice BA Oatmeal Stout.
",5
720,"Deep ebony with a maple border. Fizzling foam subsides to a dark tan  edge. Mellow aroma of vanilla, tar, cola, back licorice, and sharp bourbon. Moderate roastiness and moist soil notes. Fuzzy carbonation. Tannins add some firmness to the slick body. Soft cottony roastiness embraces the  delicate bourbon flavors. Brief earthy hop appearance at the heart of the brew. Rich toasted wood undertones couple with charred malts, adding even more firmness to the flavor. Bourbon is remarkably clean and perfumey, yet sweet enough to withstand the harsh malts and brighten the aforementioned subtleties of the whiskey. Gentle notes of vanilla and caramel cushion the vague acidity. Toasted wood and chalky black malts deepen the bourbon flavors in the finish with their resilient dryness. Delicate remnants of vanilla and black malt hulls on the tongue. This could benefit from a heartier aroma and more body/creamier carbonation. Otherwise, this is very well balanced and packs a delicious bourbon flavor.
",5
721,"True black body is topped by a thick chocolate milk foam head. The sticky froth chunks the side of the glass. Bourbon, vanilla and chocolate dominate the aroma. Theres a chocolate milk flavor thats really interesting. Slight char. Its a bit like a white russian made with chocolate milk. The stout is a good base, but could stand to be a bit more assertive as it gets lost in the bourbon by the end of the bottle.
",5
722,"Bottle. Large sized tan head and fine-small sized bubbles that were mostly lacing. Uncarbonated, opaque and dark brown hue. Malty, wood, smokey, bourbon and roasted coffee aroma. Roasted coffee flavor with a burnt coffee aftertaste. Smooth palate. Good lacing.
",5
723,"This bottled brew poured a dark brown head of fine to medium sized mostly lasting white colored bubbles that left behind a fair lacing.  The bubbles from the carbonation and the head formed a beautiful cascading flow of bubbles and carbonation as it formed a body with an opaque black color and no visible carbonation inside of it.  The aroma was of roasted barley and dark malts with a vinous alcohol content noted.  The mouth feel was fairly smooth with a very noticeable biting coffee flavor from the start to the finish.  The flavor contained notes of coffee, molasses, dark malts and roasted barley.
",5
724,"The coffe aroma filled my nostrils with delight.  The opaque black body supported no head.  The palate was tingling my tongue and teh flavor was rich, full, and nutty.
",5
725,"almost 100% impervious to light. head is light brown, mostly diminishing. aroma is chalk, chocolate, mild roastiness, lots of whiskey (the barrel aging DEFINITELY comes through in the aroma) and some woodiness. Flavor is pretty much the same as the aroma..the chocolatiness and the whiskey meld seamlessly. mouthfeel is thick enough to make you take notice and not brush this one off.  excellent stout.
",5
726,"Thanks to atpayne for this one.  Pours blacker than Yaphet Kotto, with the biggest, brownest head Ive ever seen outside of interracial porn, and more lace than a rich girls wedding veil.  This one is bottle conditioned, and has a huge aroma of malt, bourbon, and chocolate.  Tastes very malty, with huge coffee, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, and black licorice presence.  Finishes nice and smooth, with a final blast of malt, oatmealy sweetness, bourbon, and some hops at the finish.  Very complex, great mouthfeel.  A great oatmeal stout.
",5
727,"Thick, dark brown body with a fluffy, cocoa-colored head.  A nice, sweet and roasted nose on the one.  Burnt toast, chocolate syrup, vanilla, espresso beans, bourbon, a little wood and oily oats.  The body is creamy and smooth with nice suppleness.  Flavors are good, but not as great as I might have thought.  The roasted character comes out more than the barrel-aging or the sweet chocolate and caramel.  With a little more balance between the sweet and roasted elements would have been appreciated.  Smoke comes in toward the finish to keep things interesting.  The barrel-aging is done well here, as it is not overbearing or completely understated.  With a bit better balance between the sweet and roasted and this would been even better.  Great to see from an Indiana brewery not named ""FFF"".
",5
728,"Pours black with maple shallows and a tawny head. The aroma is of bourbon and roasted oats that combine into an almost coconut/vanilla ensamble. The flavor is rich with strong roasted tones and hints of bourbon in smooth proportions. The body is a bit weak and crys out for just a touch more kick, although well within the limits of a sweet stout. This is clearly one of the most uniquely flavored stouts around and is a pleasure to drink.
",5
729,"This was an interesting find at a roadside liquor store in Kokomo, Indiana.  My first impression was that this is very reminiscent of the Dark Horse stouts- it pours very dark (but not so ""molassesy"" as Dark Horse stouts) with a large tan to light brown head.  Nice complexity in the aroma- licorice, toasty sweet malt, molasses, and bourbon.  Bourbon comes up big in the flavor too, with woody, vanilla notes that complement some sweet roast and licorice.  Also had a slightly smoky flavor.  Very good but needs a bulkier body and a denser palate to reach excellence.
",5
730,"Very dark brown, blackish with a brown head.  The aroma was complex, roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and burbon.  A somkeyness fills the mouth and lingers contributing to a very nice full feeling.  Its also sweet early rolling to a roasted flavor and then a mild bitterness.  The burbon isnt noticable at first, but when it comes it provides very nice character.
",5
731,"Pours black as night with a very nice dark brown head.  Perfect lacing.  Aroma starts off with a lot of whiskey.  Almost too much.  Flavor is the same.  Once it warms up a bit, some other complexities come through and it really is a nicely rounded oatmeal stout.  I'd say the best oatmeal stout I've had.  Better than Sam Smiths or Youngs IMO.  If you see it, pick it up.  I'm glad I did.  Bought it at Kahn's Fine Wines in Carmel, IN just north of Indy.

732,"12oz btl. Pours dark medium body with a tan head. Smells of vanilla, raison, and a bit of that burbon. Tastes the same with some fruit to start and then fades to the burbon. Not bad.

733,"GABF 2010, dark pour, medium body. Roasted malts, vanilla, bourbon/whiskey. Pretty balanced as bourbon & wood lends itself & doesnt dominate other aspects of the beer. Nice stout
",5
734,"UPDATED: AUG 22, 2010 Courtesy of northernbrews	Bottle: The aroma consists of chocolate, plums, vanilla, roasted malt, and faint bourbon.  It pours a dark brown with no transparency and a small beige head that fades relatively quickly.  The flavor starts with light chocolate and a touch of caramel.   The finish has notes of coffee, vanilla, oak, and faint bourbon.  Medium bodied with mild carbonation that comes across a tad thin at times.

735,"12oz bottle. Pours a black body with a finger-width, creamy, brown head that dissipates quickly and leaves a moderate lacing. Aroma is very sweet. Thick, rich, and creamy bourbon and chocolate. A light burnt coffee, vanilla-oak, and some molasses. Mainly malty with lots of chocolate and the sweet bourbon isnt overly oaky and not boozey at all. Flavor is thinner than I anticipated, but thats only because the aroma smelled so thick. Lots of wood, chocolate, and vanilla up front with some sweet bourbon. The bourbon blends nicely with the rest of the flavors and doesnt stand out as much as the aroma. Some charred coffee grows slightly into the finish along with more bourbon and sweet malts. Finishes with a dry, woody, coffee, malty, bourbon sweetness and a hint of acidity. Fairly lengthy aftertaste following a medium body and moderate, fizzy carbonation. Overall, a pretty nice barrel-aged stout. Fairly sweet with a nice charred flavor. Enjoyable.
",5
736,"12 oz bottle.  Pours black with a tan head.  Aroma is big with creamy coffee, bourbon, and chocolate, oak, raisin.  Flavor is unfortunately on the thinner side, with the oak being the primary flavor followed by roasted coffee with some bourbon and cocoa.  I love the aroma, it could seriously be that of a top bourbon-aged imperial stout, but the flavor doesnt really follow through.
",5
737,"""Heavy cream scent with accents of cocoa, woody bourbon and vanilla. Sweet with a big creamy push and a fine smoothness. Roasted nuts, fudge, burnt toast and wood. A half inch head sits atop a dark brown body leaving good lacing. Nice one here that doesnt showcase any bourbon, but rather lets it work its magic in the background.""

738,"It would take me a bit to go back and see who sent me this in a trade.  Im genuinely grateful, I just dont want to take the time at this moment to go back and find out.  Im a bit buzzed and the weather is beautiful.  Pour is nice and black with tan accents.  Nose is sweet and malt and oats.  Taste is coffee and molasses, but lightly so.  Doesnt over coat or over power.  Rather light.
",5
739,"Nice pitch black coloured body with a fast-dying light brown head. Aroma of super strong oak, bourbon, vanilla, coffee, licorice, nuts, caramel and a ton of alcohol - nice! Lightish-bodied, if that can be believed! Relatively thin mouthful with a lot of oak and bourbon at first with some mild malt, bitter nuts and a twang of vanilla at the end. Aftertaste is mild, some alcohol is noticeable, but mainly a light finish of bourbon and roasted malt - nice, since its not so strong! Overall, a very well done beer that showcases the flavours and doesnt get drowned out by the alcohol! The smaller sized bottle is another plus - perfect for the style, and this isnt even strong, so thats perfect. Id recommend this to others and will pick up the Porter the next time Im in Chicago. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from West Lakeview Liquors in Chicago, Illinois on 15-December-2008, sampled at home in Washington on 17-May-2010.

741,"Dark brown with a thin tan head.  Aroma of heavily roasted malts, lightly bourbonized with undertones of coffee and peat.  Notes of oak and vanilla creep through as it warms.  Taste is a bit under whelming at first.  Thin bodied and mild tasting I was expecting more after taking in the aroma.

742,"Bottle pours black with tan head.  Aroma is vanilla, bourbon, coffee, and chocolate.  The aroma does not last long.  Medium mouthfeel.  Flavor follows the nose and has bittersweet chocolate, dark coffee roast, oak, vanilla, and bourbon.  Overall pretty nice.  I wish the aroma had lasted a bit longer.  And the mouthfeel could have been a bit more creamier for the style and bit more thick.  Still a nice beer.

772,"Dark dark brown to black with a quickly diminishing tan head.  The nose is vanilla, chocolate and roast.  A bit sweet, but that might be the bourbon barrel vanilla as much as the beer.  Full creamy mouth, slightly higher than average carbonation.  Creamy and malty sweet.  Noticeable, but not dominating vanilla, ala bourbon.  Chocolate and roast backfill.  Fruity acidity in the finish.  Long lingering charcoal roast.  Perhaps the slightest hint of bourobn after the aftertaste.  Not bad.Earlier Rating: 4/17/2007 Total Score: 3.2Pours a dark dark brown with a thin tan head, thinning to nothing but a glass hugging  brown foam.  The nose is very boozy.  I know its just the barrel, but the nose makes me think alcohol.  Whiskey, a little wood, a little chocolate malt, floral hops, something green seems a bit off.  The mouthfeel is about average for the style, low carbonation and a hint of thickness, but not too chewy, not too fizzy.  The flavors are in line with the aroma, but the alcohol seems to come out a bit more.  I have a hard time believing the ABV is < 5.  Chocolate malt character over the whiskey slightly woody flavor.  The alcohol whiskey element is so sweet, a little hoppy, not much roast, but a little acidic.  Boozy finish, whiskey aftertaste.  The whiskey flavors balance the sweetness, but I find this to be a bit much.

774,"Just another fantastic bottle from Acknud. Or so I expect. Here goes: Poured really black with quit a dark tan head. Its the aroma of smooth burnt toasted malt. Full bodied with almost chewy carbonation. Flavor is suggestive of those expensive Paradox barrel stouts. Notes of chocolate, wood, bourbon and vanilla. Whoops. I just figured out why barrel is in the name. Finishes smooth and somewhat astringent - or maybe thats my mouth trying to suck up the last flavor bits from my gums. Seriously, it is very good. Right in there with the Paradox and arguably much above Old Engine Oil Special Reserve. Hoosiers definitely rule.

775,"Vanity, what is vanity, is it wanting to rate a beer with the word Beastie in it just because your internet screen name is beastiefan2k. Nah.  But I did want to try this at GABF, but never got around to it with all the other good beers around.  Then a shining opportunity came when Schroppfy rated this and well he had a bottle for me to rate, score!  Well, this pours completely black and very thick.  The visible thickness of the beer is a welcomed surprise. The head is small but strong with a sticky thick lacing.  The head itself is a nice brown color.  The aroma has a lot of chocolate and strong wood alcohol essence but the alcohol is not too strong for the thick, lightly roasted stout-y aspects.  Also there is a thick cereal sweetness.  In the taste that wood alcohol essence grows, so it interferes with the other chocolate flavors.  However, the my favorite part is the mouthfeel on this brew. Its just so thick and lusciously velvety.  There is a reduced carbonation and it is tongue coating.  I feel like the Venoms alien symbiote is taking over my tongue.  This is probably the best BA low alcohol beer I have ever had, not much competition there though. Hmmm... now I need the Beastie Barrel Porter, damn my vanity. 12oz bottle into a Chimay miniature goblet.

780,"Pours very dark, bit reddish with a god sized brown head.  The aroma has roasty / toasty malt with some chocolate, cream, vanilla and a hint of bourbon.  Medium smooth body with semi-soft carbonation.  The flavor starts much like the aroma with a good amount of balance and some richness.  The finish is quite creamy.  The was significantly better than I expected it to be.
",5
781,"thanks acknud  Pours a velvety black from the bottle with a faint brown head. Smells of powdered cocoa and slight bourbon. Tatses predominantly of roasted coffee, sweet cocoa, and mild vanilla. Smooth and balanced, but not very complex for a barrel aged stout
",5
782,"Pours black with a thin tan head.  Aroma is subdued, dark chocolate and bourbon.  Flavor is bitter dark chocolate malt, black coffee, with a heavy bourbon and oak presence.  Finish is slightly medicinal and body is thinner than I would have expected.  Doesnt compare to some of the better bourbon stouts out there.

783,"Black pour with an inch-thick tan head. Aroma of chocolate, malt and a subtle hint of vanilla and bourbon. Flavor is rich, toasted malt with more cocoa, vanilla and a hint of sweet bourbon. A very nice balanced mix. Great.
",5
784,"Thanks to Bobby91w for including this one as an extra! Pours black, with a thin-ish tan head that dissipates surprisingly quickly for a stout. Aroma of stale coffee (spent espresso grounds) some oak, and a bit of molasses. Very dry. At first, you think the stale coffee is going to steal the show, but after a second, you start to detect some sweeter undertones - the malts begin to show through the bitter front end. Its still very dry - some smokey meats coming through as well - but is far more pleasant than it first lets on. This would be fantastic with a good protein-laden dinner - Im thinking ribs with a good bbq sauce. Very decent overall.
",5
785,"On tap and in bottle. Much better on tap, but good in both forms. Pours a nice looking dark brown, with a small head and minimal lacing. Nose is roasted chocolate and barley, with notes of bourbon out of the bottle. Flavor is roasted grain and chocolate, with touches of vanilla and wood. No trace of bourbon on tap, but strong out of the bottle. On tap it is creamy and smooth and very delicious. Out of the bottle, it has a good amount of bakers chocolate and finishes dry.Earlier Rating: 1/27/2008 Total Score: 3.8AWESOME!  Had this a few years ago, recently tried it again. YUM. This, to me, is what ""bourbon aged"" should be. It ADDS to the flavor, does not BECOME the flavor. All the wonferful flavor of oatmeal stout is here, with some added oak and bourbon flavors. It really brings the malt flavor to a head. I love the way it becomes complicated, but not overly so. Doesnt hurt that Buffalo Trace is a great Kentucky Bourbon. Makes me want to get ahold of Founders Kentucky Stout even more.
",5
786,"UPDATED: MAY 9, 2009 12oz - Aroma is roasted dark malts, chocolate, dry cocoa, vanilla and a touch of oak.  Pours black with a small ring head and good lacing.  Flavor is thick with chocolate followed by vanilla and roasted malts.  Palate is dry.  Very tasty.
",5
787,"Bomber from a long ago trade with STFun. Pours a deep reddish black with a thick tan head. Aroma was sweet vanilla, bourbon, and hints of chocolate malt. Sweet malt and chocolate taste with more hints of the vanilla and a touch of bourbon. Not a bad sweet stout.
",5
788,"(12oz bottle)  Pours a dark brown body with a medium brown head.  Aroma of chocolate, roastiness, molasses, vanilla, and light bourbon.  Flavor of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, and light vanilla.
",5
789,"This beer is a deep brown-black color with a medium tan head that recedes quickly. Top ring of lacing with spots underneath. The aroma consists of dark malt, oak and coffee. Full body with flavors of oak, vanilla coffee and burnt malt. Bourbon character is well-subdued. The finish is malty and leaves a nice vanilla and coffee aftertaste. Overall this is a decent Stout that falls more on the side of a good Coffee Stout rather than going overboard with the barrel aged flavors.
",5
790,"12oz bottle.  Black pour with a medium light brown head.  Malty aroma with a tad bit of hop and some booze.  Lots of malt flavor with some hop and coffee.  Very good because the alcohol is there but not overdone.
",5
791,"12oz bottle from StFun, as part of the latest round of NP10. Thanks, Josh!!! Oh how I love coffee flavors in a stout. This one has a big roasty nose, rich toasted malts with a strong barrel presence to it as well. The pour is moderate, with a decent tan head and prickly carbonation. The bourbon tends to dominate a bit too much in the taste, overwhelming some of whats there in the solid base beer. Mouthfeel is slightly thin too. But its a decent brew that Im glad to have tried.
",5
792,"Bottle received via trade with StFun.  Aroma of vanilla and whiskey.  Flavor was very nice, mellow oak, smoke, malt and toffee that mellowed into a pleasant smooth and warming aftertaste.  A good local IN beer that would do well on a national stage.
",5
793,"Attractive  oily black pour with rich rocky head.  The nose is roasted barley malt and chocolate.  Somewhat thin in texture, surprisingly in light of the thick viscour pour.  The flavors are roasted grain, chocolate, vanilla, but no wood, no bourbon, no barrel qualities to speak of.  OK.
",5
794,"Pours black with medium brown head.  Nose of bourbon and chocolate.  Mouthfeel is too thin for my liking.  Flavor is similar to nose but if there is more complexity, it does not linger enough to determine (see mouthfeel comment).  OK.
",5
795,"Chocolate. Roast.I never grow tired of this style. Lots of wood and vanilla. Wood? Yeah, it is there too. But in a good way.
",5
796,"Cask at the Noblesville brewery - Aroma of oak, vanilla, summit hops and caramel malt.  Bourbon forward flavor.  Dry and woody with vanilla, caramel and chewy hops.  Palate is smooth, creamy and balanced.  If you like bourbon and hops mixed, this beer is for you.
",5
797,"Sampled at the 2010 Indiana Winterfest. Poured a hazy golden amber with a small white head. Aroma had notes of cedar and pine and a hint of alcohol. Aroma started with pine notes, but the barrel aging seemed to have combined awkwardly with the beer.
",1
798,"On tap at new location in Broad Ripple. Pours cloudy reddish golden. Nose is fresh citrus and floral hops. Taste is nice fresh citrus hops, fruit forward with a slight barrel flavor in the finish. Becomes dry and bitter, and is overall pretty light, but solid for an ipa. Not a bad offering.
",5
799,"Pours a hazy orange with a bit of a white film on top.  The nose with bit with citrus and a bit of oak.  Basically the same with the flavor.  Medium body and easy to drink.  Tasty.
",5
800,"Available at the firkin section of the Brewers of Indiana Guild Winterfest. Little cousin of Barrel Aged Count Hopula. The bourbon on this took a back seat to the brew, which I liked a lot. Aroma was Barfly with notes of vanilla and a hint of bourbon. Flavor was much the same, with a nice woodiness thrown in. Very smooth and drinkable, the hops and wood mixed very well together. Nice.
",5
801,"Growler courtesy of hopscotch. The pour is brown with copper edges and tan head. The aroma is modestly sweet and earthy creating a pleasing aromatic sensation. The taste has a nice malty goodness to start with a wedge of tin plated earthiness. It becomes somewhat caramel like midway while a note of malt roastiness joins in and takes this toward the finish. It ends with lingering malty sweetness and smooth earthiness.
",5
802,"Growler Clear, copper ale with a mid-sized, fat-bubbled, off-white head. Good retention. Malty, buttery aroma  also notes of vanilla and very light milk chocolate. Full-bodied and lightly creamy with mild carbonation. Sugary, but not cloyingly so. Caramel, vanilla and toffee sweetness; mineral bitterness. Lengthy, moderately sweet finish. Thanks to StFun for shipping the growler to me! 
",5
803,"draft at the brewpub - Pours light amber with a small, lingering head.  It has a very mild malt aroma.  The flavor is sweet with lots of caramel.  I noticed butterscotch too though I read the menu where its mentioned, so no wonder I picked it up.  It has a light to medium body and a trace of alcohol in the finish.
",1
804,"Draft at brewery.  Red-brown color with virtually no head.  Caramel and toasted, nutty aroma.  Starts off quite malty and finishes with a very pleasant lingering caramel sweetness.   Softly carbonated and a little thin compared to some other scotch ales but this is very drinkable.
",1
805,"Light brown with little head. Very strong caramel flavor. Smooth and sweet. While I am not a big fan of sweet beers, this was a favorite.
",5
806,"On draught during my Great Lakes area brew tour. Mahogany pour with a mild white head. Malty aroma of oak, caramel, grapes. More vanilla sweetness is prevelant than a dense caramel which may be commonly found in this style. There are oak, cola,  and sarsaparilla flavors here as well. No hop character to speak of. This finishes moderately sticky with a hint of cherries. I think this is a mild Scottish ale.
",5
807,"tap at brewery - Aroma is mild and bland.  Toffee, carmel, and a bit of nuttiness.  Pours dark brown with little head or lacing.  Flavor is thankfully stronger than aroma.  Carmel, toffee, hops, and toasted malts.  Palate is sticky and sweet.  More like an amber than a Scotch ale.  A little too mellow for my tastes, maybe they should call it 20 Shilling.
",5
808,"Draft sampler at Barley island. Light brown color with a small head that diminished quickly. Light sweet caramel aroma. Medium body. Moderate sweet malty flavor with a medium finish. Soft sample of this style.
",1
809,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2006 This is the forth offering I have had from Barley Island and I must say really enjoyed this beer. Color wa dark amber with a off-white head. Aroma was that of carmel and fruit. This was a very smooth beer with no overpowering flavor. Very smooth, flavorful and easy to drink.
",5
810,"Bourbon-aged; cask-conditioned:  Coppery ruby. Broken, loose-bubbled light tan head. Bourbon, peach, and earthy peat aroma. Hints of toffee malt, medicine, fig, and candied apples. Lifeless, watery body. Devoid of carbonation. Bland mixture of sweet malts doused with medicine. Faint whiskey tannins firm up the body, but render the medicinal sweetness intolerable.  Ends astringently and medicinal with powdery pale malt whispers. Peachy esters linger alongside tight earthy hop bitterness. This is on the right path, but they really need to learn how to serve Real Ale.
",1
811,"From a sampler: This brew is a rich copper color with a thin off-white head. Fair lacing. Big malt aroma promises this to be a flavorful beer. Medium-bodied, with a sweet caramel malt flavor that is not as pronounced as expected. The beer seems to be relatively low ABV, and the finish lacks the punch I was hoping for. This brew has potential, but I think they need to toss a few more shillings into the pot.
",1
812,"This brew poured a large head of fine to medium sized off white mostly lasting bubbles that left a fair lacing and a uncarbonated hazy light brown colored body behind.  It had a medium strength malt hop aroma and a smooth thin malt flavor in a somewhat thin mouthfeel.
",1
813,"One of my favorite styles of beer; however, I was disappointed with this particular one as it was too mild for a Scottish Ale in my opinion.It poured a large tan head with small bubbles.The body was cloudy with no carbonation observed.The hue was orange and the lacing was fair.The flavor was mildly malty and the mouthfeel was thin and smooth.
",1
814,"very mediocre.  lacking the butterscotch essence promised by the label.  i don't think the scotch would be too fond of naming this beer after them...
",1
815,"Very let down with this one. I really enjoy Brass Knuckles, and liked the Bourbon Aged Oatmeal Stout. But, this one? Not so much. Very strong bourbon all around, in the aroma, the flavor, everything. The dark berries take a backseat, and the oatmeal isnt really noticeable at all. Texture is rich and creamy, but the bourbon is just too much.
",5
816,"Cask at brewery - I  must first mention that I am not a fan of the non-blackberry version of this beer. The aroma is strong bourbon with subtle blackberry. Pours black with a brown ring head and good lacing. Flavor is roasted dark malts, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and a touch of berry. I think the berry mellows the bourbon in this case.  Palate is sticky.  Overall I think the bourbon is still too much but the blackberry has a way of mellowing it out which I liked.  It just didnt have anything for me to grab on to.  Different and worth a try none the less.
",5
817,"Draft sampler at Barley Island. Poured a reddish brown with a moderate off-white head that lasted with fair lacing. Moderate sweet yeasty dark fruit aroma. Medium body. Solid same sweet dark fruit flavor with an alcohol tone at the finish.  Good drinkable brew.
",5
818,"cask at brewery - Aroma of Belgian yeast, candi sugar, cherry, and bubblegum.  Pours hazy red with a small off white head and decent lacing.  Flavor matches aroma with the cherry turning sour.  The aftertaste is a little funky, but it works well and actually gives it character.  Palate is smooth and tart, but a little thin.  Not a bad dubbel, especially when you consider it was brewed in Noblesville, Indiana.
",5
819,"Bottle-Swiped this bottle from my brother in laws fridge(is that wrong?) Small tan head that completly disipated right away. Strong coffee and malt aromas. Weak flavor and watery body
",1
820,"easy drinkin.  not the most exciting flow of flavors youl try.  more of a lunch lunch beer than a breakfast beer.  not many distinguished flavors to savor.  but quite smooth.

821,"bottle.  Poured black with a slight head.  Tasted barely like any coffee stout Ive ever had.  Slight coffee flavor but big stale olive flavor.  What the $#@%?  This cant be how it is supposed to taste.
",1
822,"Bottle from Corral Liquors in Granite City, IL. Pours black with a rocky, diminishing, mocha head. The nose is of coffee and cream, chocolate, and burnt/roasted malt. Medium-bodied, oily, and effervescent it concludes with a light bitter roasted finish. The flavor is dark roasted malts and bold coffee with a tight roasted coffee finish. A lingering coffee aftertaste follows with a faint metallic note in the background. The coffee flavor in this beer seems just a little ""off"" while on the tongue but is dead on in the aftertaste. My wife even mentioned that it smelled like I was drinking coffee as I finished off the glass sitting next to her. One of the better coffee stouts that Ive sampled, but this isnt my favorite style.
",1
823,"Do love a good coffe stout and this wasnt bad.  Poured a deep chestnut brown with a creamy mocha head.  The aroma was undeniably coffee with some roasted barley and a touch of bittersweet chocolate.  A bit thinner than I like my stouts but somewhat creamy.  The flavor was like a mocha java made with extra shots of espresso.  Pretty good stuff.
",5
824,"12oz. bottle.  Aroma is full of roasted coffee and chocolate malts, along with a touch of toffeeish sweetness and faint earthiness.  Largely opaque ebony color with a lasting, fine head.  Flavor contains a blend of bittersweet cocoa and gentle hop flavors up front, drying out a bit and seeing an influx of roasted, nearly burnt coffee that becomes stronger at the finish and brings a certain bittering, blackened grain quality.  Texture is fairly smooth and creamy, body is medium-full.  Nicely blended coffee stout.
",5
825,"12oz bottle- Nearly balck body with a nice tan head that dissipates quickly into a small ring. Aroma of roasted malt and coffee. Taste of coffee and more coffee with some roasted malt and sweetness. A nice nasting stout.

826,"6/07/2007:   Island Black Majic ""Tavern Style"" Java Stout is looks nearly black and opaque when poured into a glass and has a small, foamy, mocha-colored head.  Chocolate mocha tempts the nose and would be really nice if it werent for a bit of yeastiness that intrudes into the aroma slightly.  The flavor reminds me of freshly ground coffee beans blended with chocolate and roasted malt.  The finish has a nice roasty bitterness.  The flavors are all well balanced overall.  Ths beer has a medium body and a very smooth texture.  This was my second Barley Island beer and I am very impressed with their beer so far.  Both this and the <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Beer/barley-island-ba Island Barfly IPA  are very good.  I would recommend them both!	12 oz bottle from The Hop Shop in Indianapolis, Indiana.  Shared with Rob at our weekly/bi-weekly beer tasting.
",5
827,"4 oz draft sample at brewpub. Pours a deep black with a slight tan head. Aroma is big coffee with some bready malts in the background. Taste is typical coffee stout with a very milky creamy taste. Lots of roasted grains and no hoppiness. Mouthfeel is a little on the thick side. Great for coffee lovers, but if you dont like coffee, this one is pretty hard to drink especially compared to some of the better coffee stouts out there.
",5
828,"Pour is a jet black with a small tan head.  Aroma is all thing roasted.  Some wood smoke and coffee.  Flavor is more in the coffee catagory but not to overpowering to make it bitter.  Some chocolate helps to sweeten it so itss not so bitter.  Its not Founders breakfast stout but its a close cousin.
",5
829,"Bottle shared with HogTownHarry -- my bottle courtesy of lewis13. Pours totally black, theres no seeing through this puppy, with an average size diminishing light-brown head. Nice aroma of roasted malt and roasted coffee. Flavour reminds me of a coffee Porter but with more hops. Nice bitter roasty finish. Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel. Very enjoyable.
",5
830,"Bottle (341ml).  Shared with blankboy, his bottle.  Opaque, thick near-black with a small creamy/frothy brown head (4+).  Very bitter dark roast - coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, perhaps a hint of soy, also green hops and molasses ... and I detected a slightly off note, vaguely like plastic.  Excellent roast flavour, very bitter roast coffee beans, smooth and balanced, a hint of sour cherry tartness in the finish.  Silky, fairly thick mouthfeel, lightly astringent, moderately acidic, with a fairly quick finish.  Seemed more like an excellent coffee porter than a stout, but I quibbling - apart from that odd plastic note, this was really good.

831,"UPDATED: DEC 6, 2007 Bottle from sliffy. Very balck with small tan head. Massive coffe aroma. Tha smell ids the best part of this beer. The taste is mainly coffee with bitter finish. On the thinner side.

832,"Bottle.  Coffee and ash aroma.  Dark brown/black color with thin tan head.  Nice slightly burnt coffee flavor with a hint of cocoa.  LIghter body.  Like an iced coffee - very pleasant but on the mild side.

833,"Rated at the Pewaukee Tasting II 5/5/07.	Appearance  dark brown, modest head	Outstanding coffee aroma, but flavor and body are frankly more than a bit underwhelming.
",1
834,"12 oz bottle, via Sephiroth.  Pours a clear flat black body under a foamy one finger plus brown head.  A good amount of visible carbonation and lots of lacing.  The aroma is full of dark roasted coffee, black patent malt, and roast.  The flavor is a little too heavy on the burnt malt, lending an ashy chalkiness that overpowers the coffee and roast notes.  The coffee does come out nicely on the finish.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, watery in texture, but not thin, with moderate soft fizzy carbonation.  This was OK, but not up there with my favorite coffee beers.  A far cry from Bells Java.
",5
835,"Dark broen, with a brown head. Aroma is coffee, chocolate, and some dark fruit. Flavor is coffee dominated, with fruit, chocolate, and roasted malt. Body is a little too thin. A higher alcohol level would be help too. Still, very good. Thanks Jason, for this bottle.
",5
836,"Transparent and cherry chocolate when put to light. A thin pin-dotted strain swirls around the head. Aroma heightens the anticipation, emitting black fudge brownies, unrefined mocha beans covered in dark chocolate, hints of Madagascar vanilla bean and baked mocha torte sauce. Flavor onsets with too much frits and feverishly dissipates across the palate. Astringent edges curtail around the outer realm while a charred, French roast coffee flavor gets hard pressed to the top of burnt brownies. Hallow in all areas, and at its best in the sweetened vanilla mocha finish. Stretched too far to make an impact. Thanks for bringing it, MrFacto!
",1
837,"Thanks Matt.  The beer pours to a dark black/brown body with a brown/gray head.  The aroma is heavy on the coffee and oatmeal.  Also noticeable is chocolate.  The flavor is black patent and is very roasty with lots of coffee going on.  The palate is roasty and acedic.  I liked it.
",5
838,"Darkest brown color, no head. Aroma is awesome, and unfortunately its the pinnacle of the brew. The flavor has a bit of coffee in it, a little beer in it.

846,"Bottle from hopdog via Mystery Swap 2.0.  Pours deep blackish with 1-finger tan head.  Aroma of big coffee grounds, roast dark malt, some hops and jalapeno oil.  Very coffeeish aroma.  The taste is roasty malty, with a rich flavor of coffee and jalapeno oils...similar to Bells Java stout but perhaps not as smooth.  It gets a bit tarter as it warms.  Very unique.

847,"Bottle poured into my Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale snifter.	Pours a very dark brown. There is no head to speak of. Only a little froth ring around the perimeter of the glass.	Not a whole lot in the nose. But what you do get is some roasty coffee flavor.	Taste is roasted coffee in your face! Some good roasted/burnt coffee flavors going on here. Not getting alot of other flavors than the coffee. However, the coffee used seems to be decent so it works for me.	Mouthfeel is medium and pretty carbonated. Decent for a stout. This is a good java stout. Not over the top. Just an all around well made beer.

848,"Bottles acquired in trades with Sephiroth & BigErn (thanks!). Poured a dark black with a large sized tan head. Aromas of strong coffee grounds with roast, and chocolate.

850,"Bottle from Mike (bbb63) Thanks.  Pours out a dark brown to almost black color with a little tan head on it.  Smell is mostly coffee, with a few hints of chocolate and roasted malts.  Taste is sweet and full of coffee.  Easy to drink but it left me jacked up.  There must be quite a bit of coffee beans thrown into this.  Far better once it has warmed up some than when it was cold.  Highly drinkable.  Good stuff.

851,"Courtesy boboski.  Black with thin white head.  Moderate coffee aroma, but not sharp, a little sweet.  Thin palate.  Lots of coffee in the taste with a bitter finish.  The beer lacks some residual sweetness that would compliment the bitterness of the coffee.  But overall, a good offering.

855,"Draft at Heorot in Muncie, IN. Black color with an average frothy brown head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Solid roasted coffee malt aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture. Medium roasted balanced flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. This is a solid beer.

857,"Very dark brown/near black pour. Thin and quickly receding tan head, fut bubbles cling for dear life at the glasses edge. Although totally one dimensional, the coffee that dominates the aroma is really pleasant and smells quite fresh. Also noted are sweet and black malts, oats, a sugary component that just feels like sugar added to coffee. This nose is very pleasant, bold too, just so lopsided. Quite tasty. Roasty coffee pervades, followed by well balanced roasted grains in good quantity, mild chocolate and milder still vanilla to round things out. Finishes off dry and mildly roasty. The bitterness that lingers throughout keeps this beer balanced and makes it incredibly quaffable. Nicely surprising, a well done coffee beer.

858,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2007 Courtesy of Boboski. Thanks, Jason. Massive coffee aroma leaves no room for anything else. Its super concentrated...one of the most powerfully coffee smelling beers youll sniff. One dimendsional? You bet, but it smells good. The body is basically black with a few hints at a ruddy dark brown. The head is dimishing, mocha colored and starts about a thumb thick. Bitter/acidic coffee fore. Very dark coffee/dark chocolate in the fore. It then gets sweet with cream, milk chocolate and sweet malt through the middle. There are also bitter roast malt and coffee accents on into the finish and what may be a pretty healthy dose of hops or just the bitterness from the coffee. You like coffee? Then you cant dislike this. Again....fairly one dimensional, but fun to drink.
",5
859,"Pours a pitch black with a very stable, bubbly tan head.  Extreme intense coffee smell which is so powerful thats really all I get.  Would have liked to maybe get something else out of it as well.  Taste is definitely coffee as well.  It was pretty light bodied which somewhat disappointed me, but I suppose its not an imperial stout.  It pretty much tastes like coffee with carbonation, which isnt a terrible thing, but I was hoping for at least a little complexity.  Definitely drinkable but has nothing on founders breakfast in my opinion.
",5
860,"Pours dark dark black to brown with little getting through and a dark tan thin head.  The nose is like old coffee grounds.  Theres some chocolatey acidity, but little else.  The mouthfeel is full enough, but the beer is chalky.  Its just like I remember the Brass-knuckles being.  The flavor is a bit better, but brash.  The roasty coffee hits you right away.  theres some lactic acid like acidity and a general abrasiveness.  It leaves my mouth sandpapered.  The finish is bitter with charcoal and the aftertaste is just like licking a dirty grill.  this isnt as bad a beer as I make it out to be, but it isnt too balanced (or good in my opinion)
",1
861,"Big chocolate aroma. Very dry, chocolate and coffee flavors. Some spice and vanilla. Good stuff, tastes like a unsweetened mocha.
",5
862,"Dark brown, nearly opaque, with a thin, tan head.  The aroma is pretty strong with nice coffee, sweet chocolate, caramel, burnt toast and a hint of light fruit.  The body is full, lightly oily and smooth with light carbonation and total tongue coating.  The flavor is pretty good, but the coffee comes across a little old.  Otherwise, the combination is good and the sweetness of the malt is balanced by the bitter coffee.  Its pretty good, but just a little short being top notch.
",5
863,"A dark beer with little head. Strong coffee bitterness with a mild sweetness, akin to day-old coffee. This could use some hops to remind you that it is beer, but it isnt bad.
",5
864,"Bottle.  Chocolate and coffee aroma with a little tang and a little more sweetness.  Nose is a bit strange, has a combination of fruitiness and honeysuckle to accompany the stout notes.  Espresso and possibly plum.  Pours opaque black with a dark brown creamy head.  Medium body is smooooth, lightly fruity and chocolatey, but the coffee notes have backed off.  Some almonds with a very faint metallic touch.  Nice and malty, and the aftertaste is bittersweet.  Touch of oats.  Still needs some heft and (at least this bottle) stronger coffee notes to earn the right to the name.  Leagues ahead of the Brass Knuckles I just had.

865,"Smells of coffee.  Tastes of coffee.  Beautiful color, very dark.  Could use two sugars and a shot of half and half.

866,"Pours very dark brown / black with a dark brown head.  The aroma is all coffee that is dark roasted, no cream or sugar has been added.  Medium / light body with a light amount of carbonation.  Starts out with a lot of coffee and a light undercurrent of some citric spice.  This has far too much coffee for someone like me, but they set out what they wanted to do.

867,"bottle-thanks to vyvvy-pours mostly black with a foamy brown/beige head.  nose is all java-total coffee bliss for those that love a nice cup.  some light chocolate undertones is all i get with the java.  lots of bitter java on this one.  really tastes like a fresh cup of coffee.  somewhat metallic on the finish, but that wasnt that bad compared to the oatmeal stout from this brewery.  body again is somewhat thin.  really a fine stout here that would be great to try on tap when fresh.

868,"12oz. bottle.  Opaque black with a small light brown head.  Heavy coffee aroma, with tinges of chocolate.  Heavy coffee character dominates the flavor, some astringent roastiness and dark chocolate.  Residual roast malt finish with a slight huskiness.  Mouthfeel is light, somewhat thin.
",5
869,"bottle - Pours jet black with a one finger tan head.  The aroma had good roast malt and coffee components.  Theres plenty of coffee and dark roasted malts in the flavor.  It seemed a bit more bubbly on the palate than most stouts.  There was some bitterness in the finish and of course some lingering coffee flavors.  Its good, but you better like coffee.

870,"Bottled, November 2006.  Malty, chocolate malt aroma with brown supple head.  Medium-bodied flavor leads with smooth, clean chocolate malt in perfect proportion without that burnt overdone roasty character so typical.  Smooth espresso quality in the clean finish, again perfectly proportioned.  This big flavor beer is very well made, appropriately bitter & bodied and is one of the best beers Ive had in Indiana.

871,"You can see it pouring dark brown from the bottle, but as it hits the glass it turns to black and sports a slender cocoa head.  The nose contains freshly brewed coffee and somewhat burnt barley.  The mouthfeel is a bit thin, like a watered down cream.  It tastes of coffee, roasted barley and barley malt with a dollop of bittersweet chocolate.  The bitterness of too strong coffee intensifies into the finish.  Not bad.<font size=-4>From the cellar of <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/ViewUser.asp?UserID=1 size=-1>

872,"Bottle from Rayboy.  Pours dark brown/black with a foamy tan head.  A decent coffee stout with all the standard attributes of chocolate, espresso, bitter roasts etc.  A bit thin but very enjoyable.
",5
873,"12 ounce bottle.  Pitch black with a lasting brown head.  Smells like a morning breakfast.  Strong black coffee, and a bowl of Quaker Oats.  Nice.  This is a sturdy beer.  Oatmeal stout flavor with a coffee kicker.  Not the other way around.  Very nice.  Creamy on the palate.  Easy going finish.  Thanks to BBB63 for the hookup.
",5
874,"UPDATED: NOV 19, 2006 Deep rich black pour and a moderate tan head grace this brew.  The nose is an appetizing combination of espresso and molasses.   These lead the way in flavor, too.  The bitter coffee profile is a tad overstated, perhaps...but I still liked it.   Some chocolate, roasted maltiness. dark fruits, and oatmeal round out the flavors.  The mouthfeel was a little too thin for my liking...as others have pointed out before me.   But generally I enjoyed this one very much.
",5
875,"Bottle and served in my Expedition snifter: Pours opaque with a fading head that left some lace on the glassware. The nose detects a lot of espresso, roasted and burnt malt, oat, chocolate, plum, a hint of pepper, and grassy hops. The taste profile is one that starts coffee-ish and mostly stays that way throughout the tasting. What helps is an addition of fruity rind acidity and some hop character along with a dash of ashy yeast character. The finish is quite bitter and dry. The mouth feel is thinner than that of the regular Oatmeal stout for some reason, maybe the coffee bitterness gives a sense of thinness. It is very oily however. A good brew and I like it because I like coffee stouts but the average person may not care for a much, not subdued for sure.
",5
876,"This beer looked better than it tasted. To be fair, the Barley Island brews seem to be one dimensional. Seems to have too much bitter/hoppy flavor for a stout. Has the same base flavor as all Barley Isand brews so if you like the others, you will like this one.

877,"Draft... GABF 06... Pitch black ale with a small, creamy, brown head. Excellent retention. Mostly coffee in the nose, but plenty of chocolate as well. Lots of burnt, tangy coffee grounds in the flavor along with some dark chocolate. Almost medium-bodied and lightly oily with fizzy carbonation. Finishes roasty and mildly bitter.
",5
878,"This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of foamy brown colored fully diminished bubbles that left behind an opaque dark black colored body with no visible carbonation.  It had a mild tingly start to the mouth feel and a medium tingly finish with a mild coffee aftertaste.  There was a certain smoothness to the palate.  The flavor was mixed with coffee dark roasted malt toasted dark malt and more coffee flavor.  The aroma was a mild coffee dark malty one too.
",5
879,"Draft at BI. Small tan head, sparse lacing, opaque, no visible carbonation, and a black hue. Nose was roasted malt and roasted coffee. Flavor was roasted coffee and burnt tasting. Medium body.

880,"At the brew pub.  Pours a clean dark black with a small brown head.  The aroma is of fairly strong coffee and roasted malt.  The flavors are a very nice strong coffee flavor with the distinct flavor of roasted coffee beans lingering and covering up any other expected stout flavors that might be presant.  Its a little thin but has a great dry coffee finish.
",5
881,"pint at brewery - Aroma is strong freshly roasted coffee and chocolate malt with a touch of hops.  Pours solid black with a small brown head and good lacing.  Flavor matches aroma with the coffee standing out.  Palate is sticky and creamy.  By far the best brew BI has to offer.
",5
882,"Draft at brew pub.  Pours black with a quick fading brown head.  Aroma is of fresh hops, brewed coffee, and strong with roasted coffee beans.  Flavor is very strong of coffee, with a burnt flavor left in the palate.  Very one dimensional.  Palate is thin and lightly carbonated,  I really hoped there would be more body.  Still a great session beer.
",5
883,"Wow! this one was amazing.  Aroma is chocolate, coffee, vanilla.  Appearance is jet black with nice tan head that dissipates to thin ring.  Lots of lace.  Taste is coffee, chocolate, vanilla, slight hops, heavy malt, oatmeal.  Palate is silky smooth, some lactose in there to smooth around the edges and sweeten a bit.  Overall, very impressed! I walked out of the brewery and saw they won a silver metal at the GABF.  Should have won gold!
",5
884,"Incredible coffee aroma. Smells like fresh brewed ultra-premium coffee. I could just sit and smell this. Pours deep black with nice brown head that does not last long. Very smooth with tons of coffee flavor. I can tell there is malt sweetness there, but this is all coffee. Not bitter at all. Very drinkable. Well balanced. I want more of this.
",5
885,"Subdued.  Dark brown in color.  Aroma is nutty, coffee, dark chocolate, hickory.  Taste is coffee and chocolate with some toffee thrown in on a good roasted malt.
",1
886,"Well, not the most extraordinary coffee stout but certainly drinkable.  It opens with a very coffee-grounds aroma, and the initial flavors reflect the same tendency to a crass understanding of ""coffee"".  Coffee is best when it balances, smoothens, and rounds out the flavors, not when it bonks your tongue with a sharp bitterness.  But then, Im a guy who tends to drink a cafe mocha--or at least a cup with a cream and a sugar--rather than a black coffee.  But like so many beers, my palate was deadened over time and by the end of the bottle it was more drinkable than it was initially.  Interesting, worth trying, and reasonably decent--neither the best nor the worst coffee stout Ive had.  Bottle.
",5
887,"On tap at the broad ripple location. Pours mostly black with thin tan head. Nose is rich dark coffee and roasted malt. Flavor is dark, bitter, black coffee that doesnt seem to balance very well with the malts used. The coffee flavor itself is pretty good, but overall this one  doesnt quite do it for me.

888,"12 oz bottle poured into a nonic glass. Black with a healthy tan head which hung around the whole time. The smell was overwhelming coffee beans. The taste was also nothing but coffee flavor.

890,"Dark, dark brown, almost inky-slow pour with a slow-forming and long lasting cookie-brown head. Dark roast coffee in the nose with bittersweet chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Dark chocolate flavor with a coffee bitterness in the finish. Full-bodied, but not chokingly-so. Quite good, and it made a really nice treat after a really crappy day. ~~~~~~~~~ Cellared two years. Purchased May 2007 from Corkscrew, Urbana, IL, consumed June 2009.

891,"Growler supplied by StFun (Thanks!)  Dark black pour, a little carbonation and a very mellow coffee aroma.  Flavor was coffee, a little malt and a little hint of sweetness.  Finishes very light on the palate.  Overall a very decent coffee beer.

892,"Another rare bottle from Acknud. Pours opaque brown/black with a 4-finger dark tan head. Primary aroma is coffee! Secondary aroma is chocolate. Full bodied with creamy/frothy carbonation. Flavor is coffee, coffee, darkly toasted malt, coffee, and I cant taste anything else. It moderates, but finishes quite coffee. This is a good kick in the head stout. Arguably underrated.
",5
893,"A growler (!!!) given to me at Foot Sex Day by my pal, StFun. Thanks, Josh!!! Amazing generosity from a superb fella. Anyways, I dug the hell out of this rich and sessionable beer. Big nose is just what I want, roasted coffee out the wazoo. Thick and black, with a big-ass foamy head. The body is moderate, perhaps even slightly too thin. The mouthfeel is chalky in a way I think is appropriate to style. Deep coffee flavors with dry dark chocolate too. Is it perhaps one-dimensional? Sure, but I actually want precisely this from a coffee stout in this style. Its not gonna replace Breakfast Stout but its damn fine. Thanks, bro!!!
",5
894,"Pours black with a small, rapidly dissipating head.  Pretty much straight coffee aroma with a bit of sweetness.  Standard but nice coffee flavor.  Not bad but not as creamy as I prefer my oatmeal stouts to be on the palate.

895,"In short: A highly roasted stout (and I mean HIGHLY roasted) balanced by fresh green hops.  Very good.	How: Bottle 12oz, from kmweaver.  Thanks a lot Ken!	The look: Black body topped by a long-lasting small tan head.	In long: Nose is roasted, more roasted, even more roasted.  I could smell the roastiness from 2 feet away and to a lower extent the aroma had some roasted coffee beans.  Taste is more of the same, roasted malts, hightly roasted malts and very highly roasted malts.  All that roastiness would only be ok but where it gets interesting is in the balance part of the beer.  A whole lots of fresh green hops in there was somewhat reminiscent of chewing on hops cone.  Good session beer that has even more burnt flavour than my girlfriends cooking.
",5
896,"UPDATED: SEP 29, 2008 Jeckyl and Hyde, Yin and Yang, Good and Bad.  This was that beer.  While it carried with it a really inticing aroma of chocolate covered espresso beans,  treacle, and toffee, the flavor really was a let down.  It had a nice coffee/dark chocolate beginning and then, bam...nothing.  It just dropped off the palate in an instant and what was left reminded me of drinking a seltzer water.  A nice black hue, medium bodied with a one-finger thick tan head.  I think if the beer had more depth of flavor, it would score much higher with me.  Decent beer, but could have been much, much better.

897,"12oz bottle.  Pours opaque with a thin tan head.....light lacing.  Tons of fresh coffee and cocoa dust in the nose.

900,"12oz bottle-pours a light brown ring for a head and black color.  Aroma is wow coffee.  Taste is coffee, some hops bitterness.  Well done for the coffee lover, which isnt me.
",1
901,"Bottled.  Poured black with a short-lived cap of beige head.  The aroma picked up cold, dry-roasted coffee with just a touch of sour dark fruit that really worked for it.  The flavor was also coffee-focused with a more pronounced sour fruit and woody impression.. finished dry with coffee, toasted oats, and some residual sourness.. most likely a bit past its prime, but still enjoyable.  Medium-bodied, spicy, and drier on the palate with plenty of coffee roast.. the sourness was actually refreshing on the finish.  Solid.
",5
902,"12 oz. bottle poured into shaker- poured nontransparent squid ink black, some tan bubbles around the glass for a head, low carbonation.  Aroma of cofee, well roasted malt, and dark toffee.  Hits the mouth with a high-medium body, coffee taste hits you like a freight train with no brakes right from the starts and lasts well after the finish, a note of cream on the end as it tails off.  Out of balance, but sometimes you need that from a beer.
",5
903,"Bottle. Pours pretty darn dark with a respectable tan head. I enjoy the coffee presence in the aroma: solidly roasty, sharp, and well defined. Some ashtray notes and slightly sour cream ar noted as well. The mouthfeel is slightly prickly and of pretty average density. The coffee carries over well into the flavor, distinct, genuine, and sharp. There is a faint creamy sweetness and a touch of mocha and something just a bit sour in the finish. I really enjoy drinking this beer. I cant say its the best coffe stout Ive ever had, but I can drink a lot of these and have no qualms with it.
",5
904,"This is a palate destroyer, so make sure you rinses thoroughly after trying this one. Pours a dark brown body with a semi watery body. medium sized head with a pleasent lightly roasted coffee aroma. Mouthfeel is semi dry but also very light. Starts off sweet and burnt tasting, and ends with a lingering finish of cocoa.

905,"Smell is coffee - but almost a sour note in the background. Flavor is pale and non-impressive. Just like drinking a weak coffee at Dennys.

Well-roasted coffee and espresso and bitter bakers chocolate in the aroma; very pleasant nose.  Medium mouthfeel: following the aroma, plenty of dark, roasted coffee and dark chocolate; not incredibly deep (predominantly coffee over a basic chocolate malt core), but still pleasant; a touch chalky mid-palate.  Medium finish: bitter chocolate, coffee, and a touch of breadiness.

913,"Pours a dark mahogany brown that shows slightly translucent on the edges.  A small, foamy, khaki colored head dissipates quickly, leaving a minimal ring around the edge.  Virtually no lacing noted.  The nose is strongly roasted, comprised primarily of bitter, dark bakers chocolate and intense coffee notes.  Likewise, the flavor is very straightforward.  Bitter chocolate and coffee are all the really come through.  Medium bodied and smooth, this one makes for easy drinking, but lacks fullness.  Finishes with a lingering, intense roastiness coating the tongue.  Overall, a pretty nice, sessionable coffee stout.

914,"UPDATED: SEP 3, 2008 Bottle thanks to Acknud!!!  Black beer nice dark brown head.  Smells of coffee.

Pretty smooth and drinkable, but I wish the finish had a little more fullness to it.

918,"12 oz thanks to tytoanderso.  Pours brown black with a tan head.  Nose is roasted malts and coffee grounds with a little chocolate.  A slight creaminess to the flavors that are roasted malts, coffee grounds, nuts and chocolate.  Drinkable and decent.  But nothing special.

923,"12 oz bottle.  Pours a nice rich deep chocolate black with a velvety tight frothy head and nice lace.  Carbonation is very high though.  Aroma is strogn with dark rich robust dark roast coffee- and reminds me a lot of the Bells Java- it has that fresh coffe ground smell and is sharp and earthy with a licorice character which I like.   High carbonation detracts from the flavors a bit- ligther on the coffee, with some chocolate malts, chocolate mints,  leather, tar and anisette.  Finsih is a bit tart and licorice like and the mouthfeel again is hurt by the over carbonation.
",5
924,"Thanks tytoanderso.  The color was dark chocolate/black.  The aroma was coffee, espresso. chocolate, and roasty malt.  The flavor was strong coffee, some hops, and roast.  The palate was average.  The finish was roasty.

927,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2009 VERY solid java stout! Looks like ink when it pours, and creates a very thick and frothy tan head. Aroma is awesome, all malt/chocolate/coffee. Taste is much the same, just a tad watery. I usually complain about brews being too strong, but this one should have been slightly stronger. This is just me nitpicking though, this is really delicious and another good offering by Barley Island, a really underrated local brewery.

928,"If happiness was a beverage, this would definately be what it tasted like.  As the bottle describes, ""inky black,"" I couldnd describe it better myself.  Mild tan cream head and heavy coffee aroma leave me wishing I had this as an airfreshner.  Black Majic is smooth, like Guinness, but better.  Finish is nutty and roasty and delicious.  Coffee and beer... best of both worlds.   I have yet to find a better beer in a bottle.  Its only competition is Surly Coffee Bender, which sadly isnt available for purchase.  Black Majic Java Stout... near perfection.

932,"12oz bottle poured in an English pint.  I bought this as a one-off item in Granite City, Illinois.  BIBMJS pours... (drum roll, please)... black.  It has a small tan head that doesnt stick around for the majic show.  The nose is solidly coffee with loads of butter and hints of toffee.  the body is meaty and thick just the way it should be in a stout.  The coffee has a nice flavor without overpowering the beer.  The oatmeal not only adds body to this stout but adds a nice smoothness.  The buttery flavor comes out especially well in the finish.  With the medium-to-low alcohol this beer sports you could tag this as a great session beer.  If I were to suggest any improvement it would be to add a touch more oatmeal to balance out the hop & java bean bitterness.  It would be nice to see how this beer faired if it were juiced up to an imperial level.  I feel this beer is a bit underrated by the community but the masses have spoken.

Not a lot else going on, as the coffee dominates, and makes this pretty one dimensional.  I could have a cold coffee, but instead Il have a black magic.  Hmm...I not a coffee drinker, so Il pass.

937,"3-5 month old bottle from Shigadeyo, drunk on 11/2/07Black body, with a medium-high clarity and a large, light-tan head showing moderate retention and light lacing.Typical coffee stout aroma, and fortunately, its very aromatic.  Vanilla, fresh beans, dry chocolate notes and tastefully light amounts of caramel collect at the edge of the nose.  Light hop bitterness invigorates the senses and pushes the coffee and malt flavors through to the finish.  Some crispy popcorn-like notes nearly remind of diacetyl, but I dont think there is any here.  Quite dry and with that papery, beany note that is inevitable in coffee stouts.  Hop resins persist on the end, but the smooth choco-vanilla malts do not peter out.  No alcohol noted, medium-high to high strength of aroma.Very soft, but high levels of carbonation lend a creamy-fluffy feel to the body, as light chocolate fudge braces the palate for a big dose of roasty coffee and strong vanilla flavors.  It slowly dries the palate, with help from hop bitterness and slightly astringent black malts.  Caramel sweetness perks up as it warms and breathes, and light looseness in the body is exposed as well.  No alcohol noted and quite drinkable.  Perhaps a little less caramel sweetness and more interplay between vinousness and coffee would help.  I dont see the need for this much pine and citrus bitterness either.

951,"12 oz bottle shared with padrefan98.  Nice black pour with only a small amount of head.  Aromas were decent with mostly coffee, but I also thought I picked up some coconut.  The flavors were bitter cappuccino.  Somewhat watered down, but decent.

955,"On tap at Barley island in BR.  Nose is full of hops with noticable sweetness. Pours dark brown with a pale and fading head. Has the initial bite of an ipa but immediately mellows out in to a smooth cream like taste and feel. Very nice and quite different.

956,"Served the first glass at the broad ripple location in a goblet.  The appearance is very deep/muddy brown. Think  murky muddy waters. Much more brown than black but clearly darker than an IPA with alot of ""stuff"" going on in it and NO opacity to be found. Slight fading white head that leaves decent lacing. The initial aroma is mostly sweet citrus hops with faint sugar. The flavor is very smooth and sweet. Citrus and juicy fruit hops come through as well as dark malt and chocolate. The smoothness adds a nice milk chocolate accent that rounds this out nicely. The finish stays sweet and reminds me of a hopped up orange creamsicle with an alcohol punch. By far the most impressive offering Ive had at B.I. to date. Get it while you can!

957,"A Mes rate. Bottle. Huuuge thanks to Grant.Bought from the brewery itself. Cant believe Im adding a US beer. But add it I must according to Grant. Black brown with a thin tan film. Huge chocolate, huge bourbon, hugely complex malt but you know what? This has so much finesse its unreal. Im litterally blown away. The balance is utterly superb. NOTHING is even close to being overdone. I am really not used to this in US beers. As an Englishman, this is perfect. Vanilla, liquorice, some peat, earth, wow. This is brilliant. Huge yet cuddly and cute. Big bourbon finish but again its done SO WELL. Bloody excellent. Thanks so much to Grant for this very rare, very special treat.
",5
958,"This draft brew from the brewery poured a very large sized head of foamy finely sized white colored bubbles that were long lasting and left behind a and a very good lacing. The complex funky aroma was malty. The mouth feel was smooth at the start and mediumly tingly at the finish. The funky flavor contained notes of malt and was  sweet. A decent one but not one that I would consider buying again.

959,"Pint at brewery Aug 21, 2006 - Aroma is wet bread dough, lemon, and hickory/maple that make for an interesting combo. Pours light brown with a small head and decent lacing. Flavor is citrus, yeast, and spice. The syrup used is apparent giving this typical farmhouse ale a smokey twist. Palate is tart and creamy. An interesting and different take on a farmhouse ale that works well.

960,"Draft at Mad Anthony Oktoberfest. Poured a off-white head that mostly diminished, minimal lacing, transparent, no visible carbonation, and a yellow hue. Malty, hoppy, sweet, fruity, and spicy nose. Flavor was sweet, malty and hoppy but not overly done. Smooth mouthfeel. Light-medium body.
",1
961,"tap - Pours yellow and a little hazy with a big head.  It has a sweet, yeasty aroma.  The flavor has plenty of sweet maltiness, plus mild yeast and hops flavors.  The body is medium and its bubbly on the palate.  The finish is somewhat dry.

962,"Tap at 2006 GTMW.  Aroma of lemons, banana, straw malt. Overall fairly sweet aroma.  Cloudy straw-yellow with a nice white head.  Flavir is sweet with banana, bubblegum and grainy malt. Good, but the bubblegum stands out a bit much for me.  Light to medium body with high carbonation.
",1
963,"Tap @ GTMW 2006.  Lovely, hazed and muddy golden orange in color with a creamy white sheaf and clinging wrung.  Sweet and bitter orange peels abate the nose, along with cloves, banana, orange zest, lemon seeds and buttery vanilla.  Sugary refreshment hits the tongue and reveals a touch of fusel burn and a hopped up anthem.  Effervescence meets husks and coriander thats been dashed far too liberally.  Orangey stream teams with green buds and dry bitterness.  Medium-bodied with curtailing pils malt and a lemon juice flavor shine on grapefruit rind shavings.  Harsh bitterness is never dormant, and quite dominant especially in the end, meeting up with bitter orange peel for the last goodbye.

964,"Served in a goblet. Herbs + alcohol aroma. Red color yet clear with a white cap. Very bitter, light sweetness, tastes like kind bud. (Yes, kind bud.) Full body, creamy, average carbonation.

965,"Tasted 8/11/10. Sampler from the Brewpub. Filtered with a dark brown hue. Trace ring of head. Aromas of toasty cereal malts. Medium bodied with a really nice malt roast.

967,"From a sampler: This brew pours a rich amber color with a medium thick off-white head. Thin and sticky lacing. The aroma consists of hops and citrus. Medium-bodied and nicely hopped, with some fruit and malt present in the flavor as well. The finish is crisp and dry. Overall this is pretty decent, if a little bland.

968,"They must have really reworked this one since BBBMike last had it!  Very hoppy nose from a nice light amber color.  Malty at first sip, medium body.  I went back for a few more smaples to make sure that I was really tasting a wonderfully balanced pale with loads of caramel and even some fruity pale malt hints. Hoppy presence at finish is quite enjoyable. Long tasty finish.

985,"A bonus from a trade I did with StFun.  The pour was copper and ever so slightly hazy with a barely off-white head that produced thing rings of lacing.  The aroma was some caramel malt, pine hops and pepper.  The flavor was spicy, peppery hops steamrolling over an overmatched caramel backbone.  Succinct finish and relatively light in body.

",5
987,"Pours a golden orange with a pretty thin head that disappears quickly.  Aroma is light and somewhat sweet...not a lot of hops, and even a dash of sourness mixed in...pretty odd for an APA.  Flavor is some burnt malts, and a whole lot of bitterness, without much of a hop profile coming through otherwise...maybe a hint of the Cascade hops, but Im striving to find much.  Palate is a bit watery and underwhelming.  Not a very impressive beer, which seems to be all about being bitter...concur with others that this is a bit confusing for the style.
",1
988,"An OK pale ale. In the bottle, this one is dominated by wheat and grass, but on tap, it is much more hoppy and malty. Has a copper finish in both versions, which I didnt care for too much. I liked the different hop profile in the tap version. A good session local.
",1
989,"12 oz. bottle courtesy of a trade with BBB63.  Pours a hazy amber with a thin linen white head that faded to a ring after two sips.  Very light aroma of grassy hops.  The flavor is mostly grassy hops with virtually no malt.  This flavor is short-lived and the beer finishes bitter and tasteless, much like the white pith of an orange.  The bitterness lingers on the palate for a bit after the swallow.  Not very good.
",1
990,"Slightly hazed amber color with a modest head of dark cream colored bubbles. Sweet aromas, with pale malt, caramel, cream, orange zest, and pumpernickel. A lot of things in the aroma, but none of it comes together that well. Caramel and orange flavors dominate. Some floor cleaner qualities, such as Murphys Oil Soap. I am reminded of a stronger amber with a touch more hopping. Im just not getting it.
",1
991,"A good fruity drink with a mild hoppiness throughout. Pours orange and cloudy with a medium creamy head. A short lived tart aftertaste follows as you progress thru your drink. No punches here, its a decent brew.

992,"pours a bubbly cloudy with sediment copper with persistant white fizzy head.  sweet citrus hop aroma.  mild front with acidic hints to mild bitter finish and dry aftertaste.  mild hops showing a light citrus finish.

993,"Pours a dark amber in color.  There is no head on the pour, only a small ring around the perimeter of the glass.  Smell is light hops with mostly malts.  Taste is mostly cascade hops.  There is a certain bitter, almost soapy taste to it.  An alright beer.
",1
994,"Medium amber body with an off white head. The aroma is oranges with some almonds and toast. This is typical for an APA smell. The taste is soapy with some piney resin and grapefruit. There is no malt background to balance out this bitterness. The body is sticky with a fairly full mouthfeel for the abv. I am not impressed with this one.

995,"Bottle from Acknud. Thank you sir. Pours a golden amber body with a smallish, off white head that quickly fades to a ring of foam. Spotty drip lacing. Nose of sweet malts, toasted grains, muted spice, hops, vegetal and floral notes. Not nearly hoppy enough on the nose for an APA. Flavor is more of the same, malt and grain sweetness dominating, with the hops cowering in the background. Light bodied, low carbonation. Watery palate. Finish is short, watery and bland. I hope this wasnt fresh, because it was pretty bad.
",1
996,"Nearly clear golden body with a thin white head, quickly and fully diminishing. Vague hops leave the glass first in the aroma, vegetal and citric at once. Toasted malt is moderate and incohesive. DMS is scattered in clumps throughout each inhalation. The flavor is much the same, with rampant DMS and sad hoppiness. Malt is moderately toasty and everything is vegetal. The finish is lightly sweet, lightly bitter and oily. The body is prickly with light carbonation, watery and oily pockets inter-dispersed and colliding. Awful.
",1
997,"Courtesy Quake1028.  Pours a cloudy orange, with a small white head.  Smells of toasted malts, some caramel, and not really much semblance of hops.  Definitely smells old.  The flavor has a tiny hop presence, but the malts are most dominant as this definitely has some age to it.  Would have liked to have it fresher and will revisit it again if I get the chance.  The malts and toasted caramel are the most dominant flavor, and it probably sholdnt be that way.

Hazy light-medium amber color, unfiltered and conditioned, and yielding a fairly slight, thin head.  Flavors include a blend of citrus fruitiness, gentle sweetness, lightly toasty malts and a wash of faint bitterness and acidity throughout.  Rather thin, finely effervescent mouthfeel, body is light-medium.  Early on, the malt seems to make its presence felt quite a bit more, but as the finish fades away, the hop character is what lingers.  A serviceable enough Pale.

",1
1011,"Bottle.  Very nice peach/apricot malt aroma with slight hops.  Hazy orange amber with moderate head.  Pronounced malt flavor for an APA expertly blended with the piney hops.  I really enjoy this beer due to it having a much stronger malt flavor than the average APA.  Good stuff.
",5
1012,"Bottle from Chalet Party Shoppe in Goshen, IN. Pours a medium amber orange with sudsy off white head. Strange aroma of green hops, wet grains,  must, and yeast esters. Initial flavor of caramel, toasted grains, and tea that transitions to muted grassy hop middle. Finish had a slight citrus tartness. Some of the malt profile has a german vibe to it. Not bad, but its missing something that I can not pinpoint.
",1
1013,"This beer pours a medium brown body with a nice foamy head.  Not a lot of retention.  Aroma is very tart hops with some pine notes.   Flavor pretty much matches the aroma.  Some malt can be found underneath the hops but definitely play second fiddle to the hops.  Blind Tiger is a straight forward beer that ambushes the taste buds with tart hops.  Its not a bad one, either.

1014,"bottle-i made my way through a fairly fresh 6pk about 2 months ago.  At first, i didnt care for the beer at all.  I had flying dog IIPA wild dog right before it, so i was biased.  Subsequent visits to this beer definately improved.  nose is mostly fresh citric and lighty grassy/green hops-pretty pleasant.  flavors show pale grains and light hops, but for some reason, i get a lager character, maybe in the hops.  I dunno.  its pretty decent though.  body is soft with pleasant sharp carbonation.  short finish of light citrus.  a decent session pale from Indiana.

1016,"From a 12 oz. bottle with no freshness date, sampled at cellar temperature in a pint glass.		Poured a hazy orangey copper with a foamy off-white head that settled into a thin sudsy lacing.		Aromas of toasted caramel and grains, floral, citrus and a touch of pine.		Moderate carbonation and a crisp, dryish, smooth medium bodied mouthfeel.		Tastes of sour citrus, earthy as well, the hops have a soft bitterness, toasted grain and a light caramel, nutty butter, towards the green pine needles come out, and a dryish, sour fruity, malty finish.		I looked at the website, but I have no idea what they mean by ""Tavern Style Pale Ale,"" I could see this being related to a 1930s APA recipe or a take on the English pale ale. Easy smooth drinkability, not bad, I prefer this to their IPA.
",1
1017,"Pours a clear medium amber. Aroma is floral and soap. Definitely soap. Taste is floral hops with little malt and that soapy taste. Sharp bitterness provides more bite than I expect from an APA. Mouthfeel is average. Not very drinkable at all.		I had this beer a few months ago and it was much much better. Looking at the scores on here, they seem to be all over the place. My assumption would be that Barley Island has some serious quality control issues and are sending out batches that vary wildly from batch to batch. I really liked the last one I had (hence buying more), but would never buy THIS product again.

1018,"Flowery, hoppy aroma.  Copper with thin head.  Flavour had mild fruit notes and hops were distinct, but had some soapy notes.  Bitter start to finish.

1019,"Pours a cloudy orange/amber with a respectable white head.  Aroma is mild hops and sweet malt.  Clean crisp sweet malt and maple syrup flavor with significant, but not over done, hoppy tartness.  Pretty decent American pale.

1020,"Pour is a cloudy brown with a average white head.  Aroma is a nice mix of earthy hops and dark malts.  Also has a rye aroma to it.  Flavor is decent as well.  Very much citrus hops with some butterscotch and dark fruit.  Never heard of this brewer before but this is pretty darn good.
",5
1021,"bottle - Pours copper with a big fluffy head and a pretty good hop aroma.  The flavor seems lacking though with flat, rather off tasting hops joined by mild malts in an overly thin brew.  A dry finish ends this so-so offering from Barley Island.

1022,"Pint at BI - I havent had this in the past and Jeff Eaton (owner of BI) said they have been ""tweaking"" the recipe.  Aroma is crisp citrus hops, pine and earthy carmel malts.  Pours hazy orange/brown with a medium head and good lacing.  Flavor is initially a citrus hop zing that quickly fades to a chalky maltiness.  Palate is rather thin for such aroma and flavor.  I say keep tweaking until you can make it finish as well as the IPA and you will have a great APA.  Certianly worthwhile as is.
",5
1023,"Bottle.  Lemon, orange, grapefruit in the sweet nose.  Opaque cloudy amber body with strong carbonation and a tall, creamy, lacy beige head.  Lots and lots of sediment in the bottle.  Lightly hoppy.  Rubbery bitterness to start is grainy bitterness in the aftertaste.  Moderately sweet and bitter, this is the Mild of PAs, and about as good as a Pride & Joy.  Watery citrus the main flavor, light-bodied.  Nice and easy session beer.
",1
1024,"Pours copper with lots of carbonation and a large creamy head.  Aroma has caramel malts with some spicy / citrus hops.  Medium body with a nice amount of sharp carbonation.  Taste has some caramel, but it is mainly spicy hops.  The finish has even more of the spicy hops and comes across as prickly with the hops and carbonation mix.  A good pale ale.

1025,"Thanks to Hippie4beer.  12 oz bottle.  Pours a hazy light copper and a cool lasting thick fluffy head.  Aroma is traditional citrus cascade-like hops with that cascade like harsh metallic hint.  Flavor is a bit weak, some more citrus, light grassy hops, light caramel malt backbone.  Clean light bitterness in the end.  Pretty standard APA.
",5
1026,"12 oz bottle: pours a slightly cloudy orange with a small, quickly dissipating white head. Aroma of hairspray. Flavor is moderately hairspray like with hops and slight earthiness. Taste is mainly hops with a very pronounced bitterness in the finish. Average or less.

1034,"A very nice bronze color, looks rich, with a nice collar of cream-colored foam.  Lots of citrus in the aroma, grapefruit pith with some fruit and soft caramel behind.  Flavor is quite nice.  A solid, full-bodied, toasted caramel malt that does not show itself in the aroma, the citrus and grapefruit pith hop character, a little viscosity that is fleeting, and a smack of bitterness that complements nicely but is probably too strong and acidic for a pale ale.

1035,"(22 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with atpayne, thanks Adam!) Another massively overcarbonated bottle of beer that despite the careful pour has yielded more head than actual beer.  Also, the nose is fairly soapy, which often seems to go hand-in-hand with the massive carbonation.  Anyway, after several minutes, the foamy, light-tan has died down to only a quarter-inch, so I can finally proceed.  Well, the flavor is also moderately soapy, but its mild enough that I can overlook it and focus on the other flavors.  Mildly sweet, fruity, and lightly malty initially, the finish shows some mild but balancing bitterness, as well as a light smokiness.  It tastes okay, I guess, certainly nothing special, but of course, that soapiness cant be ignored either.  Unfortunately, I cant smell much beyond the soapiness, maybe some sweet fruitiness and some floral hops.  Body is about medium, and despite the huge head, carbonation on the palate isnt expansive at all.  Dark amber in color and fairly cloudy with some small, dark specks settling to the bottom of the glass.  The head never fades below a thin but complete layer, and there is a significant amount of foam left on the glass.  Not a great introduction to this brewery, but Im hopeful some of the others will be better.

1036,"Barley Island makes some of the best looking/smelling beers I have ever encountered.  Luckily they usually taste good as well.  This beer is no exception.  Very dry and hoppy with a twinge of a sour aftertaste.  Good stuff.

1037,"I think this one is getting a bad rap. I have tried bottles repeatedly, and been to the pub. This is no SNPA, Red Seal, or Stone, but it is pretty good. Nice citrusy/floral hop aroma, good malt foundation, especially for the ABV. Nice hop flavor. Sort of a session APA - thats a first. Maybe theyve had QC issues judging by the other reviews, but Ive had consistently good APA from this place.

1038,"Bottle acquired in trade with atpayne (thanks!). Slight gusher when I opened this one. Poured a medium and hazy amber color with a huge, huge off white head.

I agree with Erics rating that the tastes were a big let down (especially compared to the aromas).

1039,"Poured a lightly hazy, glowing orange color with a small, off white head that left spotty lacing on the glass.  Aroma of pine, citrus, floral hops, nuts, grass, and sweet malts.

1045,"Hazy gold  ale with barley any head.  Slightly off chemical perfume aroma with beginning of band aid and apples.	Nice hops and malts but the beer is definitely off, as there is a long sourness, almost grainy in post taste. If it was fresh, this could be good.

1046,"Aroma is wheat/malts, spices and orange/lemon.  The flavor is wheat grain/malty along with a decent underlying fruit/spice flavor.  Relatively light in body but with a witbier its expected, this was pretty good.

1047,"[Bottle] Gusher! Pours a light golden color with a ton of head that lasts for a long time. Aroma is of grainy wheat, lemon and light yeast. Mild esters and light hops mix with cereal grains and grass in the taste. Light and fairly well balanced. OK overall. I thought this one may have been a bad bottle considering how it started, but the taste was fine.
",1
1048,"12 ounce bottle from Whole Foods Market Indianapolis. Pours a hazy golden with an explosive head. Not a gusher from the bottle thankfully but the rocky white head is so huge this is taking forever to pour. Aroma of bread, spice, butter, corn. The taste is almost champagne-like... grapes, apples, bread, spices. Tart finish. Doesnt smell great and annoying as heck, but Im actually liking the taste.
",1
1049,"UPDATED: AUG 30, 2011 Okay, I dont need this much foam. Also, an actual aroma would be good, other than alcohol. Bland, oh wait. This is a Belgian White. Why do they call it a blonde? Grrr... well, I guess its not all that bad.  The head sucks.  Bought a six pack, so I get to re-experience this gem. Bottle cap came off with a loud pop like champagne. This isnt good as a Belgian white or a blonde ale. I think its fitting that they are calling this a blonde. This is not a blonde ale.  Even rate beer has it as a Belgian wit. Thats what its closer too, for sure.

1052,"Poured from 12 oz bottle, enjoyed after a Blackhawks win!  Aroma is mostly of cloves and spices, not really my cup of tea.  Appearance is practically yellow with little to no head.  Great aftertaste, of light banana and cloves with those backing spices that give it a nice but not overpowering kick.

1065,"Barley Island Sheet Metal Blonde is an cloudy yellow color with a quickly disappearing white head. The aroma is faint with orange, citrus and to borrow from Davinci, ""gingerbread like"" spiced qualities. The flavor is light with gingerbread notes. The finish is very light and very nice. I enjoy this beer, but find the taste a bit strange!
",1
1066,"Hazy pale straw color, medium head, little lacing. Aroma is raw wheat, mild orange, baking spices and vanilla... gingerbread like. Flavor is much the same, returning to that gingerbread character I noticed in the nose. There is some mildly tart citrus in there as well.  Finish is mildly floral/spicy noble hops. Mouthfeel is watery with a soft finish. This would be good in the summer if served slightly cold on a very hot day.
",1
1067,"Hazy straw color with a small white frothy head.  Aroma of sweet oranges, wheat, coriander, spices and a small amount of vanilla.  Really awkward flavor.  Like wet wheat flower and orange juice.  Pancakey.  This is just plain awkward and kinda gross.

1068,"hazy straw yellow with a few chunks floating around lotsa head, lasts nicely. nose is citrus mainly lemon, some clove. flavor is different wheat, citrus i agree with another rating that says it almost has a coconut milk taste but different flavors then i have had in a wheat before.  nice dry finish

1069,"Hazy medium gold with a bright white head. Sweet banana bread, with some almonds. This is a pleasant, sweet smelling brew. The taste is typical wit with some flat Sprite and corriander notes. There is a little bit of bread crust with some bananas in the finish. A decent wit, but pretty boring.

1071,"Bottle.  Nice beer although hardly an attempt to regurgitate a Hoegaarden verbatim.  Id hold this against them if they advertised this as a Wit -- but they dont (its just Ratebeers classification).		A little darker than a true Wit but with nice, prominent foam.  Flavors are lightly citrus spiced like a wit but very malty/bready.  Sort of a bready witbier.  Interesting choice and well-crafted.  I liked it!

1072,"Nice and spicy.  A great blond ale.  Wish I could get some here.  Well carbonated.

Taste is overly spicy, with coriander and orange peel. Creamy banana, wheat, yeast, and hints of lemon and orange. A bit pretentious, but a surprisingly good effort. Enjoyable.
",5
1074,"Thinly headed over a proper witbier body... hazily pale golden with moderate carbonation. Lemon, dough, cereal grain and allspice aroma with hints of Hallertau or Saaz. Flavor expands upon this beers spiciness and shows a mildly-hot capsaicin quality. Otherwise tart, again lemony, again bready. Rather full in the mouth with a lingering fruity-sourness.

Very generic wheat beer flavor. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side for a wheat. Not anything I would like to drink on a regular basis.

1079,"A nice looking wheat.  Aroma offers coriander but not a lot more.  First sip features a little zing on the back of the throat but that lasts for only a couple of sips.  It settles on the tip of the tongue.  Overall it is a creamy mouthfeel.  Flavor is full of clove and spices.  Sweet citrus fruit is also easily noticeable.  An interesting and unique wheat.

1082,"From a 12 oz. bottle with no freshness date, but from the case box that it came in, I learn this is the bottled version of the new April 2007 recipe, sampled at cellar temperature in a pint glass, first without, then with the recommended slice of orange.		Poured a cloudy pale orangey, yellowish golden with a large frothy, foamy white head that slowly dissipates into a thin sudsy lacing, minimal amount of laced sticking. When I added the half slice of orange, this witbier acquires an even more orangey character.		Without the orange slice, had fruity, wheat malty aroma, lightly spicy, clove and coriander, slight herbal, with orange slice, wheat bready, orange fruity, spicy with a more pronounced clove, a light coriander, and the herbs are cut a bit.		Good, steady carbonation and a crisp, dry, silky smooth medium-light bodied mouthfeel.		Without the orange slice, tart yeastiness, fruity wheat malts, lightly clove and coriander spiciness, a touch of hop spiciness, with orange slice, the yeast loses a little tartness while becoming earthy, the wheat malts dry out, become biscuity, the clove and coriander are more of a feature in the taste, a peppery spiciness, and dry, yeasty, bicuity, spicy finish. I prefer this with the half slice of orange, becomes a truer witbier when added, improves the taste.		Last spring when I took a vacation to Belgium and the Netherlands, I had plenty of witbiers served to me with slice(s) of orange, plus at some of the better brewpubs Ive been to, this practice was done there too, so I dont feel it is a ""crime"" or ""beer geek sin"" to add a little orange to your witbier, especially when that is the brewers design and intent.

1083,"Pour is a hazy yellow with a white head.  Aroma is cloves and banana with some spice in there.  Flavor is very spicy and corriander with notes of clove and lemon.  A pretty good hefe/wit and prob one of the best from this brewer.

Opaque cloudy lemon color with a short white head.  Bitter clove much stronger in the mouth, and yes, reminds of nutmeg.  Generic wit notes.  Medium body with a touch of prickling, smooth yeasty aftertaste.  Decent, but I cant get behind this combination of flavors.

1085,"Bottle.  Pours a hazy yellow gold with a very nice white head on top.  Nose is wheaty with light bananas and spice.  Flavor was delicious.  While I am reviewing, I am actually suprised to reminded that this was a wit.  I thought it was more of a hefe, but in any event it was very good.  Lovely, citrus/sour finish that finished the creamy mouthfeel.  Id have another if it were around as it was very much a thirst quenching brew. Thanks to lewis13 for the bottle.

1088,"Pours slightly darker than a macro.  No head at all.  Slightly spiced candy Belgian aroma.  I have to say when I first sipped this I didnt know that the style was and expected a American Pilsner from the name.  I thought something was wrong when I got a definite Belgian flavor.  I read the bottle to see what it was.  OK...not knowing what I was getting I could pick out the style.  But after knowing, this is bad.  It has that sort or what I call dirty candy Belgian taste to it but it really tastes like floor cleaner.  Sort of like Pine Sol.  Super perfumy.  No body.
",1
1089,"Pours blonde with a small white head that leaves fairly quickly.  The aroma has a rich quality either from the white or orange - it doesnt list orange on the label, but it seems to have some.  Medium / light body with some sharp carbonation.  Flavor starts with nectarine flavor that has some plastic to it.  The some spiciness enters that goes through to the finish.  There is also some light astringency that comes through.  Not a bad beer, but much better of the style out there.

1090,"12oz - Aroma is appealing.  Yeasty bubblegum, banana, lemon, and spice.  Pours transparent gold with a quickly dissapating medium head and great lacing.  Flavor is mostly ginger and other spices with the yeasty banana and bubblegum follow up.  Palate is smooth and a little tart.  Overall, it was better than I expected since the lable says blonde.

1091,"I almost subtracted points for appearance, since this poured such a clear straw color.  With a one-fingered head.  Quite an aromatic nose, soft wheat, oranges, a hint of banana and bubblegum (?), a dash of corriander, and some other spices at work.  Soft and smooth in the mouth.  The wheat/banana/bubblegum/orange blend continues in the flavor along with corriander, clove, and other spices.  It finishes on a mildly lemon-tart note.  If I was rating purely for style, Id subtract points, fur shoor, but I found this to be a refreshing, tasty brew, even if it is a hefeweizen/wit hybrid.

1093,"Thanks to Hippie4beer for the trade on some barley island stuff.  Pours a light hazy gold with a fluffy lasting white head.  Aroma reminds me of victory whirlwind with a bit more malt profile.  Phenolic lemony and bubblegum.   Flavor is lightly wheaty, more bubblegum phenols, light clove spiciness, and some citrus notes.  Smooth body but carbonation is a bit low for the style, although I did swirl the bottle to get some yeast so that may have decreased the carbonation.  Honestly better than expected.  Good wit.
",5
1094,"UPDATED: JUN 6, 2007 12oz bottle- A slightly hazy golden in color with a head that dissipates very quickly into a small white lace around the glass. An aroma of spice and wheat. Has an initial taste that it is going to be a nice tasting belgian(more like a hefe) then the taste drops in the middle but comes back on the back end. Has potential.
",5
1095,"Poured to a hazy golden color with thick white head that diminished quickly, and good lacing. Strong wheat aroma, but the flavor was dominated by spices, mostly corriander, clove and cinnamon. Actually much better than I expected, and the spices left a good finish. The spices may become overwhelmiong if drinking several of these at once, but a very good tasting beer for sipping.
",5
1096,"Bottle.  Pours a very hazy yellow with a thin white head. The aroma is full of citrus, coriander and a bit of malt.  The taste is very sweet, with just a touch of coriander, but mainly citrus, with a slightly tart finish.  Start up the lawn mowers, because this beer is perfect for summer sipping.

1097,"Hazy blonde colour.  Aroma of lemon, coriander, light maltiness.  Sweet and soft with a flowery, honeyish nature and nutmeggy accent.
",1
1098,"(22 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with atpayne, thanks Adam!) For a Belgian style wheat ale, this beer tastes awfully sweet and has a very clear presence of clove.  The usual assortment of witbier flavors, the wheat, the coriander, the orange peel are all here, but lag behind the sweetness and the clove by a fair amount.  There is a slight bitterness extending the finish, helping to offset the sweetness.  The nose still shows plenty of clove, but is less sweet and more balanced, with funk and wheat having more interplay with the spices.  Light-medium bodied, gently carbonated, soft and easy on the palate.  Half an inch of white, tightly-knit head sits atop the hazy, light golden body.  Highly unusual for the style, sweet, clovy, minimizing the coriander, it seems like a girlie version of witbier, no offense to the girls who like a more classic examples of the style.  That said, its still pleasant enough to be an easy quaffer.
",1
1099,"Bottle and served in a pint glass: Clean straw color with a small fading head and some lace. The aroma has notes of lemon, sweet malt, a hint of clove and orange peel, and a wheat ester. The taste is a straight forward citric and wheat overtone with a light spice background. Ever similiar to Upland Wheat Ale but not as refreshing. An okay brew, would like to try on a hot summer daze.

1101,"Too bright (clear) for style and gold in color on top of that.  The base beer should not be this rich gold in color even if it is filtered.  It has a thin, white head.  Definite wheat overtones in the aroma with spicy, clovey yeast character, a twist of lemon, and coconut milk.  Flavor is very strange, but not bad.  I taste some nutmeg and a lot of pina colada with a spicy, nutmeg dryness.  This is almost one of those alco-pops.

Its flavor contained wheat  notes.

1106,"Props to TAR for this one!!!!   Short lived white head w/ a ghostly light golden body.  Big time coriander nose w/ some wheat malt and peppery yeast.  hints of orange citrus. Very appealing!   Well balanced, spicy coriander & orangy citrus up front, but finishes a little dry & bitter in the aftertaste.  Cream of wheat flavored malt in between.  No tartness or crispness in a true Belg. Wit.  Medium carb., dryer m/f, lighter body but not watery.  Not a bad Wit, but not a classic either.  Very quaffable & has lots of flavor, but missing a few key elements to be a true classic.

1107,"Pours a cloudy hazy golden with thin white head. A touch of wheat, citrus and coriander in the aroma, but with the strange presence of chicken broth.  Starts full (for a witbier at least) and semi-sweet with a touch of dry orange peel.  Finishes crisp and semi-dry. Thanks atpayne.

1108,"Thanks to atpayne for sending me this brew. I think that the blond chick on the bottle is kind of cute. 	 Pours a hazy blond body and a massive ivory head. The aroma and flavor bring some floral citric notes of orange peels, lemon and grapefruit. There are big spicy black pepper, musty clove and coriander even some pinesap. Some earthy flavors and aromas of Cyprus mulch, and compost. I really dig this beer. Its not over done in any one area and everything seems to bend nicely. Big yeasty body and fat doughy bread notes. Dig It?
",5
1109,"Clear golden body with a huge, fluffy white head.  Sweet, slighlty spicy aroma.  Banana and orange, coriander, vanilla, grains of paradise, coconut, peaches and a touch of lightly tart wheat husk.  The body is moderate and refreshing.  The flavors are great and have a nice balance with elegant fruity sweetness at the start moving to spice in the middle and finishing with a mild tart kick.  The finish is lasting and refreshing as heck.  I really liking this style right now, at least in the heat of the summer.
",5
1110,"Enjoyable.  A bit cloudy and yellow with some white around the edges with a large foamy head.  It has the aroma of a typical belgian wit, its yeasty and spiced.  The flavor is crisp, biting, and citrusy.  There is a full wheat malt flavor and feel and several spices are noticable.   Barley Island continues to impress me with their beers.
",5
1111,"Honey golden. Tall and thick white foam collar sticks to the glass. Very bright aroma loaded with chamomile, mandarin orange, coconut oil, rose petals, and pulverized coriander. Some phenolic esters and wet straw, as well. Soft, very fluffy carbonation paired with a slick body. Gorgeous interplay between buttery chamomile and leathery yeast flavors. Swaths of sweet honeyed malts and, almost nutty, malt husks slice their way through the bold yeastiness. Coriander overexerts itself, lending more sweetness to the rich honeyed malt elements and masking much of the leafy hops aspects, rather than highlighting them. Tongue-coating oaty smoothness adds more body. Deliciously juicy, throughout, due to the fresh mandarin orange flavors. Finishes minimally spicy yet resoundingly floral and sweetly malty with a smattering of buttery chamomile and honey underneath. Phenolic belches complement the lingering honey flavors and lessen the sweetness, somewhat. Quite the fanciful witbier.

1112,"Probably a good wheat ale, but since Im not much for that particular genre, I dont particularly care for it.

1113,"In short: A lame Abt-style attempt.	How: Bottle 12oz.  Vintage 2008, grey wax top.  Consumed when approximately 1.5 year of age.  Sent to me as a bonus by someone.  Thanks dude	The look: Cloudy ruby body topped by a medium beige head with medium retention	In long: Simple timid nose of dried dark fruits.  Taste is almost as restrained as the nose.  Dried dark fruits, candi sugar, toasted crusty bread, plums, dusty yeast.  All that turns into a disturbing burnt caramel a burnt fruits after-taste.  Overall this is not very tasty for such a strong ale.  Even the alcohol is nowhere to be found.  The beer is aiming for an Abt kind of flavor spectrum but mostly fails.  Not a bad beer, but not something I want to drink again or needed to drink once.  But they say beer can actually be good for you if on average people would drink 1 or 2 beer every week.  Thats good news, but some of us have to make up for the 2 billions of non-drinkers.

1114,"12oz bottle.   Ruby red with a beige head.   The aroma hasa decent level of vague fruity esters with caramel and bread crust as well.

1116,"Received a bottle of this in trade @ DLD 2010.  Overall, I would say this beer is worth trying once, but not something I would seek out again.  Alcohol is somewhat noticable, but not overbearing.  Leaves a bit of a spicy aftertaste.

1122,"White wax dipped 12oz. bottle. Pours a clear, dark, crimson-chestnut color with a quickly diminishing, smooth tan head. Sugary sheeting with micro-spots drips down the glass, but leaves no real lace. The aroma starts with a dark candy sugar base, with loads of fig and dark raisin. Theres a hint of earthy hoppiness and just a touch of dry cocoa that brings a nice balance, taming the sweetness. Flavors expand to show some burnt brown sugar and molasses, with a faint hint of smoke lurking deep within. Again, the cocoa roast and earth flavors keep things in check. The palate is medium-full, with balanced carbonation, though the finish is sugary and a bit acrid, with some alcoholic heat. Overall, its a solid, tasty Belgian strong with a nice nose, but the finish is a little over the top.

1128,"This white wax covered bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized tan colored bubbles that were long lasting and left behind a hazy strongly carbonated . The strong aroma was vinous raspberry and malt hop. The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish with a medium vinous aftertaste. The nice flavor contained notes of malt hops vinous and raisin. Delicious and one I would certainly buy again.

1133,"Dark amber pour from a wax dipped 12oz bottle. Aroma is fairly simple -  malt and molasses, with a hint of hoppiness almost buried by the sweet smells. Very nice. Flavor is dominated by malt with brown sugar,  a bit of sour molasses and a hint of fig. A lot of hops bitterness hits the tongue, but it is scarcely noticeable amid the surgery sweet onslaught, made more so by the very well disguised ethanol sweetness. Some sort of spice comes through in the finish  Allspice perhaps. Sorta like Cinnamon but not quite. The 10% ABV is a nice feature. Palate is thick and sweet   a brew to sip by the fire on a cool autumn  night. If you answer a personal add and hope to meet a SWF, but find its a Single White Friar  just ask for a brew. You could do worse.

It seems to come together nicely into the finish.

1145,"Wax covered bottle and served in my Ommegang Anniversary tulip: Pours a deep cola brown with a fading fizzy off-white head and spotty lace. The aroma has notes of candi sugar, molasses, plum wine and figs, a hint of clove and cardamom, and a touch of tobacco. The taste starts fruity sweet and spicy with along spicy finish. Some notes of alcohol, red wine barrel and hop bittering. The mouth feel is quite sticky and lush, warming and soft carbonation. I am perplexed by this brew, there are some excellent characteristics but it still missed the mark overall for balance. ""E"" for the effort never the less.

1148,"Bottle. Short, off-white head, mostly diminishing atop a hazy ruby brown body. The aroma was heavy with candi sugar and dark fruits, plum and fig. Notes of caramel, cherry and a hint of clove and mustiness. The flavor was moderately to heavily sweet and lightly bitter. It finished moderately sweet and lightly to moderately bitter with some hot alcohol throughout. A vinegary taste floats underneath the sweet, almost cloying, flavor. Medium to full body with a smooth texture. Modedrate carbonation. Good, but the flavors do not blend together as well as they do with the best of the Belgian strong ales.

1165,"Thanks for the bottle Yaniv!  Pours a darker slightly hazed reddish brown with a thin warm tan head.  The nose is creamy with rich malt and a subtle belgian fruitiness.  Dark fruit and chocolate.  I cannot smell any alcohol.  Really remarkable clean, especially considering my past experience with Barley Island.  Creamy full mouthfeel, heavy, but not inappropriate.  The flavor is in line with the nose.  Perhaps better.  Big ass malt, very creamy.  Bubblegum.  Dark fruit, some chocolate.  Ridiculously sweet, but the malt is so round it works.  A bit of fruity Belgian yeastiness.  Lingering roast might be out of place given the Belgian yeastiness, but I just really like this beer a lot.  I may have overrated this... but it is drinking really great and I think this brewery need some encouragement to make more brews like this!
",5
1166,"Draft at BI - Aroma is clean and appealing.  Belgian yeast, bubblegum, chocolate and pungent spice.  Pours dark garnet with a ring head and great lacing.  Flavor is strong and tasty, matches aroma with some caramel added in for good measure.  Oily palate with a full lingering mouthfeel.  A very nice brew.
",5
1167,"Pours dark brown / burgundy with a lightly sudsy tan head.  The aroma has sweet brown sugar, creamy caramel, toffee, vanilla bean, heavy cream and Belgium maltiness.  Nice aroma.  Medium / full body with very gentle lightweight carbonation.  The flavor starts with the brown sugar aspect with a bit of sourness and anise.  There is some Belgium-like aspect in there, but it is more faint and the cream is gone.  The finish is fairly sharp with traits in the initial taste.  This is quite good and the best Ive had from the brewery.  As it warms a caramel / dark toffee aspect comes out quite a bit.
",5
1168,"Appearance: Pours a hazy, chestnut brown body with no real head formation beyond a few stray bubbles.		Smell: Toasty, dark caramel maltiness with a constant undercurrent of rich fruitiness and sweet-smelling candi sugars. Light dash of cinnamon on top.		Taste: Toasted bread crusts crumpled into gooey caramel sweet. Hefty amount of candi sugar. Moderate sweetness. Lightly tart fruity plums and raisins spiced with, well, spices. No more than an extremely faint bitterness. Touch of alcohol.		Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Moderate carbonation.		Drinkability: A fairly pleasant sipper. Worth at least picked up a bottle. Whats the worst that could happen?

1169,"12 oz bottle.  Dark purple brown with a thin ring.  Nose is raisin, orange and dough.  Smooth and chewy with buzzy carb.  Taste is plum, blackberry jam and banana.  Fades leaving peppery red wine.  At first i thought this was too sweet but the vinous finish balances things nicely.

The taste reminded me of a BSA mixed with a doppelbock, loads of yeast, sweet fruits, caramel, cherries, some strong and sweet malts. A fizzy and full mouthfeel. A spicy flavor also, mostly banana and clove flavors. Very nice.

1173,"bottle from strykzone.  Dark brown pour.  small tan head. Aroma is very nice with fruit, caramel, syrup,and maybe a hit of spice too. Flavor is very nice.  Dark dried fruits, caramel, chocolate, spice and some banana are present.  I am very surprised at some of the low ratings for this beer.  I enjoyed it very much.
",5
1174,"UPDATED: JAN 8, 2009 I obviously liked this one a lot better than most of the raters so far. But, what they disliked was what I liked. Pours an excellent deep purple, with small floaties swirling around. Aroma is full of dark fruits, spice, and candy sugar. Plums, dates, raisens, and maybe even some toffee. Touch of spice and tobacco. Flavor is plums, candy, sugar, spice, bananna, clove, burnt barley, and a touch of chocolate. Nice.
",5
1175,"Pours very dark ruby brown in color. There is a sheet of head forming on the pour but is quickly gone afterwards. Smell is very dark ripe fruits. Too much plum and dark candy sugar.	Taste is even more of the unfavorable notes from the smell. Has a bit of a tobacco and burnt flavor to it. Whatever it is exactly is just way too dominant and overbearing. Almost tastes like they waxed the top of the bottle with no cap on it. Not enjoyable by any means.
",1
1176,"Pour is thin reddish brown with a small late forming head.  Nose is malt, sugar, and alcohol.  Flavor is full of fruit at first.  It is very sweet with some alcohol.  Faint spice notes and some chocolate covered cherries. Brown sugar shows up late.   Feel is thin with just the faintest zing.  Sugar is overdone and dominates totally.
",1
1177,"12oz bottle from WLV.....pours a darker caramel brown with a thin film of slightly off-white head.... aroma of sweet ripened fruit and sweet confectionary sugars.... expected the flavor to be on the sweeter side but this wasnt the case.  dark fruit, almost a little sour apple in nature, caramel malt, and a little alcohol come together in a not so cleanly way in my eyes.  carbonation level suffices.
",5
1178,"Pour is a dark brown with no head at all.  Aroma is dark fruit with some candi sugar and some of the alcohol.  Flavor is almost a candi sugar bomb.  After the swallow some dark chocolate and cherries are left on the tounge to rescue it.  A very slight alcohol is there to give you a nice warm feeling.  This is a well made beer and you can tell a lot of work went into it but it is also a tad too sweet.
",5
1179,"Pours a little bit darker than cola brown with just a scant bit of tan head. Nice fruity aroma of dried cherries and cranberries. I also pick up some Christmas candy and a pepper note. The flavor seems to be a more complex blend of fruit with some chocolate and caramel syrup, but its not sweet. There is a very pleasing alcoholic finish. Full body with a slick mouthfeel. Enough carbonation to keep the beer from being still. This beer is a really nice surprise. Recommended.
",5
1180,"2008 bottle from West Lakeview.  Pours a thicker darker chestnut brown with a small frothy beige head.   Sweet aroma of Belgian yeast, candi sugar, banana esters, light touch of dark chocolate, and a bit of mint-chocolate cookies, a bit cedar with some noticeable alcohol, smells almost like a dunkelweizen.    This beer draws some parallels with Bells Hell Hath No Fury.  First taste is semi-sweet bakers chocolate, lightly burnt candi sugar, touch of banana but quite estery, light spices and some light dry chocolate cookie.  Some earthy dark bitterness, tart ripe berries and finishes a bit metallic.  Really easy drinking, the dark bitterness is nicely balanced.   Drinks like a chocolate soda.  Medium/light syrupy body, light chalkiness with minimal carbonation.

1181,"Sampled from 12-oz, white waxed top bottle and shared by Bobby91w and Bulldogp04 during Surly D-Day. Pours a semi-clear reddish copper amber brew with a decent off-white head that has some nice retention and excellent lacing. Aroma of light banana esters, cloves, candi sugar, a touch of dark pitted fruits, and some mild herbs. Taste is medium to full bodied, lightly carbonated, with flavors of multi-grain malt, banana esters, just a touch of cloves, candi sugar, a touch of plums, and a hint of dark berries. Finish has a slight metallic texture from its high alcohol presence with a semi-dry banana/yeast aftertaste that is quite refreshing. Uf Da! Lots of alcohol in this strong Belgian ale. Nicely done!
",5
1182,"Tasted 8/11/10. Sampler from the Brewpub. Hazy with a dark amber hue. Brainy and ring of off-white head. Woody and earthy aromatic notes. Undertones of vanilla. Medium bodied and somewhat unblended. The base altbier is nice but it is completely overwhelmed by the bourbon barrel flavor. Earthy and spicy flavors with the vanilla oakiness taking the front seat as far as flavor goes. Nice to try, but this was overpowering and overt.
",1
1183,"Poured black with a fizzy large light tan head.  Strong alcohol aroma, some roastiness and some acidic paint thinner.  Taste is roasted coffee with a surprisingly large alcohol character.  OK, but I not sure the barrel did this one a world of good.

1184,"pour deep black, with nice full forthy head.	nose is has slightly swet notes, and lacing coats glass fully, but settling quickly.		tastes esp. bitter for a porter, but i a fan of bitter beers, so this is a nice touch. oak notes in finish, but not detecting much clasic bourbon notes (vanilla, caramel, etc) My roommate gave me this for xmas, bought it before he tried it. he seemed a bit dissapointed w/ it, but i wuite enjoying this. nice an bitter porter with slight sweet notes to balance it... though i not detecting much of the bourbon barrel aging.		perhaps it was the manhattan i had earlier.
",5
1185,"Pitch black pour with Dr. Pepper edges; no discernable carbonation, minimal head that dissipates quickly but leaves 1/4-finger foam.  Lace settles quickly back down into head.		Cinnamon, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, coffee, hint of chocolate in the nose.  Would rate higher except for faint whiff of medicinal aroma.		Mouth is chewy, aerated.		Chocolate and roast coffee up front on the tongue, slightly bitter malt/hops, brown sugar at finish with slight intionations of bourbon.  Seems well blended overall if a tiny bit shrill on the back end.		Has a minor tart aftertaste that I could do without (hard water used?).  Otherwise pretty well done.  I imagine a cask conditioned sample direct from the brewery (if available) would hit the spot.
",5
1186,"Bottle:  Courtesy of MI2CA via trade.  Moderate aroma of bourbon, chocolate, and vanilla.  Pours a dark brown with some transparency.  Huge off-white head with phenominal retention makes it almost impossible to pour.  Flavor is loaded with bourbon, so much so that other flavors struggle to get thru. Light chocolate and vanilla sneak thru up front with light roasted coffee in the finish and some light acidity.  Fizzy mouthfeel.
",5
1187,"Bottle.  Medium dark brown opaque pour.    Strong bourbon aroma, with some alcohol and maybe a woody/earthy hint. I felt the standard porter aromas were very obscured by the bourbon and unbalanced.   Medium roasty malt flavors, with bourbon and chocolate.  Way too carbonated.

1188,"Poured dark brown with a large tan head.  Aroma of bourbon dominating the roasted malt.  The flavor too was dominated  by the bourbon with more roast underneath.  Medium body with a lively mouthfeel.
",5
1189,"Pours brownish red with a bigh tan head.  Heavy bourbon aroma and lots of malt.  Heavily carbonated (too much so for this style).  Some bitter chocolate in flavor, but also has a slight medicinal taste as well.  Kind of thin on palate, but may be because overcarbonated and may be old.

1190,"Bottle acquired in trade with atpayne (thanks!). When I opened this one, a foaming tan head came gently rushing out of the bottle. Poured a dark brown color with a large sized off white head. Aromas of bourbon, whisky, light vanilla and wood. Tastes of whisky, bourbon, light coffee, and light chocolates. Lively and somewhat over carbonated body for my tastes. I was really looking forward to this one as I am somewhat of a sucker for barrel aged beers but found this to be somewhat of a let down. Id like to try some of their other barrel aged offerings.
",1
1191,"Poured a dark brown, red color with a light tan head that quickly diminished, leaving no lacing on the glass.  Aroma of sweet chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon.  Taste of chocolate, vanilla, smoke, and whisky.  The mouthfeel was full of carbonation, but overall, it was rather thin.
",1
1192,"Very good barrel aged porter!  I have to admit I had no idea who they were when I bought it.  Aroma is very woody with vanilla being the dominate flavor followed by mild amounts of chocolate and carmel.  Appearance is dark brown, opaque with a frothy tan head.  Flavor is malty sweet.  Bourbon comes up heavy on the finish.  Well done.

1196,"Bottle, dark brownish/black in color, absolutely huge head/carbonation.  great scents of bourbon upon opening and then came the foam eruption, pleasant taste of bourbon and malt but carbonation overload.  would like to try again when not as carbonated
",1
1197,"Bottle courtesy of qdog.  Eruptive head.  The damn thing pours like an angry, agitated Belgian beer.  Head is tan.  Deep brown color with red tones.  Nice aroma, malty with bourbon notes.  Palate is destroyed by the carbonation.  Fizzes like baking soda and vinegar in the mouth.  Flavor does carry some roasted malt but the bourbon really comes out in taste.  Probably would be really nice if the carbonation was toned down.
",1
1198,"Dark and portered with cream-hued head. Bourbon strong in the flavor but not acrid. The combo of porter and bourbon creat a toasted coconut flavor which is quite tasty. Very much like BBA stout. In fact, this is easily BBA Stout-Lite. Not very complex and would be much better if the porter element was richer. The bourbon helps, the porter lacks.
",1
1199,"I dont think this porter is nearly as good as their bourbon barrel-aged oatmeal stout.  Deep red-brown body, medium tan head.  Roasted chocolate aroma with plenty of bourbon (wood and vanilla).  The flavor was dominated by the bourbon, which would be great if I was writing this review on www.ratebourbon.com, but Im looking for beer here.  The underlying porter is just too weak to carry the barrel flavors.  There is just a touch of roasted malt and light sweetness associated with the actual beer.  A let-down considering how good the stout is.
",1
1200,"This one had carbonation issues like the oatmeal stout.  First pour was all foam.  Eventually it settled into a mostly opaque darkness with a frothy tan head.  Aroma is full of warming bourbon, sweet malts and a touch of dark chocolate.  Starts with a pleasant oaky sweetness with nice bourbon balance and robustness leading to a bready smooth bittersweet cookie dough finish with lingering bourbon oak flavor.  Incredibly complex for such a low alcohol beer, which makes it very drinkable.  Many thanks to atpayne for this fine brew!
",5
1201,"22 oz bottle: dark, mahogony, red-brown...wonderful thick, beige head, incredibly thick and tight.  Roasted vanilla bean aroma, with some pine and whiskey.  Slight grain at the beginning of a fairly smooth and creamy palate.  Toasty flavours with more hints of whiskey wrapped with some caramel and some chocolate.  Roasted lactic bitterness in the finish.  Enjoyable, but off just a tad.

1202,"Ok, while this beer looks average, it taste great!  Just a smooth porter that is really quite enjoyable.

1203,"Bottle pours a dark brown, almost black, large foamy off-white head, strong carbonation, with hardly any lacing.  HUGE Bourbon aroma, with hints of molasses, raisins, and oddly enough, Tang.  Fairly heavy Bourbon up front, but it slowly turns into a nice roasted malt flavor.  However, that then subsides and you get more of a vanilla bourbon flavor on the finish.  Okay body, but a tad thin on the mouthfeel.  Could stand to be a bit heavier, but good nonetheless.  Thanks goes out to atpayne for the trade!

1206,"Bottle. Medium sized tan head and fine-small sized bubbles. Uncarbonated, opaque and a reddish brown hue. Malty, hops, wood, toasty, whiskey and a slight spicy note. Flavor of coffee, bourbon, smoky and malt. Smooth palate and fair lacing.
",5
1207,"This bottle brew poured a large sized head of fine to large sized mostly lasting light brown colored bubbles that left behind a good lacing.  The body was a opaque dark black-brown color with no hope of seeing any carbonation.  The aroma was aromatic with a dominant bourbon scent that was very vinous.  In fact, I cant remember  calling an aroma vinous in the last 1300 or so beers.  The mouth feel is mildly tingly initially then finished with a vinous bourbon flavor nothing like any porter I have ever tastes.  You can taste the wood in it.  The flavor contains notes of bourbon wood dark malts and a mild hint of chocolate.  Very burnt and roasty.
",5
1208,"This is a deep brown to black beer with red hues and a large brown head.  The aroma displays vanilla, chocolate,  and a smooth burbon sensation.  Its a very round feeling complex beer with a plesant vanilla flavor along with chocolate, coffee and oak.  The burbon isnt very present until the beer warms up, but then its unmistakable.  There is a nice light bitterness that lingers that makes this a nice beer.  This is the second in Barley Islands Burbon Barrell beers, and so far both have been very nice.
",5
1209,"Bottle at Fest (Since it was Sunday, they wouldnt sell me any, darn!): Reddish brown hue with a small creamy tan head and very good lacing. The aroma has light Bourbon notes of vanilla, oak, whisky in addition to the toasty and bready malts, floral hops, current and berry fruit tones, coffee, mocha and a light spice. The taste starts fruity and tart (some lactic nature) on top of a sweet chocolate malts base. Smoky and chalky undertones which leads to a touch of the barrel aged character upon the finish. The feel is crisp yet smooth oily body. Nicely done with just a bit of the bourbon notes, would have again.

1210,"Another in the series of bourbon-barredl aged beer from Barley Island.  A deep garnet body with a thin, tan head.  The aroma is really cool.  There is some vanilla, coconut and whiskey, all in very subtle states, atop a strong base that seems to be like a real porter.  Coffee, chocolate, slightly sour milk, and no strong roasted character.  There is a nice smooth, thickness to the beer that is not overbearing, but also not the consistency of motor oil.  The flavor shows more of the slight sour milk, the bitterness of the dark malts and the light sweetness of the residual sugars mixed with the barrel aging.  While not as good as the Oatmeal Stout, still quite enjoyable.

1211,"bottle from stfun consumed at daks 1/19/11.		right on porter color with a small tan head.		it smells of oak, roast, ash, mellow bourbon, chocolate and caramel. after it warms a tart fruitiness shows up.		the tartness carries over in to the flavor... seems to be mildly infected but it works. there are also notes of ashy charcoal, chocolate, roast and a little bit of tannins on the finish.		tartness makes the medium body quite bright. carbonation is crisp. 7/3/7/3/14+

1214,"12oz bottle. Popped it open and its definitely a gusher...infected? Well see. Pours a very deep brown, mostly black colored body with a two finger-width, dense and foamy, light brown, gushing head that continues to grow until it slowly collapses and leaves lots of lacing. Aroma is a possibly infected sour dark fruitiness mixed in with a decent barrel-aged porter. Some caramel, roast, vanilla-bourbon, chocolate, and wood. Flavor seems less infected and is actually quite enjoyable despite the light sourness. Lots of roast, vanilla-bourbon, and wood up front with a moderate caramel and chocolate. Sour dark fruits, some coffee, and more wood before this finishes very dry with a moderate, roasty, woody bitterness along with a good amount of vanilla-bourbon, coffee, and dry cocoa. Just a slight sour dark fruitiness in a lengthy aftertaste. Medium body and fairly high, lively carbonation. Overall, I initially thought this was infected, but it may be what they were going for. The sourness has more of a negative effect on the aroma than the flavor. The flavor is actually pretty solid with lots of dry roasts, vanilla-bourbon, and cocoa, but I cant get past the thought that this is infected. Either way, infected or not, this was okay, but Id like to try it without the attached sourness...if thats possible.

Flavor of burnt dark chocolate, cake batter, bitter hops, light licorice, toast and celery. Meh.....not a fan.

1225,"12 oz. bottle from West Lakeview Liquors.  Absolutely gushed upon opening.  Pours a cloudy brown color with a massive beige head.  Upon smelling after the gushing settled, this showed some funky, fruity, brett-like character, which leads me to believe it may have been infected.  Either that, or they were shooting for something more like New Glarus Unplugged Old English Porter.  Anyway, I still wound up liking this, as along with the brett and fruit, there are some good barrel notes of vanilla, caramel malts, bourbon, and oak, and some roasty porter character.  Medium-bodied, with a tart, roasty mouthfeel and tons of frothy carbonation.  Infected?  Maybe, but still interesting and good.

1226,"Tasted 8/11/10. Sampler from the Brewpub. Relatively dark and opaque. Thick ring of khaki head. Aromas of dark chocolate, anise and maple. Full bodied with similar flavors of dark chocolate and subtle coffee notes. Good use of the wood. Really adds a dimension to the flavors and palate. Subtle cola sweetness in the malt bill. Rich and thick and great drinking! Delicious!

1227,"On tap at GTMW.  Poured deep brown with almost no head.  The aroma picked up sweet, toasted black patent malts with tangy oak, vanilla, and a touch of bourbon surrounding and riding out the back.. a little coconut there too.. decent components, but it didnt come together that well.  The flavor found a lot more bourbon than the nose suggested, with vanilla and milkier chocolates beneath.. too much barrel.  Medium-bodied at most with lots of tangy barrel on the palate.. too sharp to be pleasant.

1230,"A glorious sight sits before me; burnt browns, earthen blacks, and slivers of mahogany toss tantalizing glances my way. Dark khaki puffs laze about as if they too know what dark riches lurk below. Little lace to speak of, but her head lingers throughout our slow session together. Shy is not her middle name. Before I even have time to raise said glass to my nose, bourbon reaches out to grasp me in a cozy hug of tannins, vanillin, licorice, and bourbon. Breathing deep, I savor even more bourbon which is undercut by the most decadent of European chocolates. In the back of her nose is freshly charred wood reminiscent of a cooperage at work, barrels receiving their blessing of smoke and fire. Rising from the smoke and fire are mouthwatering cinders of sweet smoke, burnt sugars, and caramel. Yum! Shy isnt my middle name either, and I waste no time diving into her dark depths to make sweet love to bourbon, wood, and porter decadence. Rich, creamy, and silky smooth, she glides across my tastebuds like an angel descended. Melted chocolates ride atop a wave of licorice and vanilla, drying my palate with subtle ease. Lingering in her long finish is bourbon and vanilla-tinged warmth along with a touch of char. Each quaff continues to ooze bourbon while her porter namesake savors the show. Vanillin and tannin, bourbon and caramel, spice and warmth, licorice and char: my heart, body, and soul are truly rich.			Bourbon barrel-aged beers, how I love thee And though some may disagree, tasting the bourbon is most certainly not a detriment. The Beastie Barrel Porter from Barley Island Brewing was right up my alley-o-bliss from which I feel no desire to return any time soon. If you can find a bottle or two or three, be greedy and bring them all home with you. Trust.

1231,"12 oz bottle		Hiding in a mixed six pack in the cellar I pulled this out on a whim. The result was very disappointing given my expectations and the fact that it was aged on bourbon barrels. Honestly this beer would have been better if it had been released without any extra aging. Fortunately I only had the one bottle so I am not stuck with five more.		Aroma / Appearance - The thin feeble head was timid as if ashamed to be associated with the beer beneath. The color of weathered teak at least it did a good job of complementing the base which was on that thin line between deep brown and black. Cheap Hersheys chocolate coupled with a diet cherry soft drink and a scoop of vanilla ice cream give this a cheap feel. The oak is there but not with enough force to break through more than infrequently.		Flavor / Palate - Strong notes of roasted coffee kickstart the senses. The taste profile is otherwise on par with the aroma including an afterthought of bitter oak. The creamy mouthfeel is nice but when the heaviness continues into the finish it detracts from the rest of the experience. This is basically a one trick pony - dont be fooled by the label or the additional aging. I am sure Barley Island can do better though.

1233,"It seems that as the whole barrel aging thing catches on more and more there are more and more lighter beers being aged in bourbon barrels and normally not to good effect. The problem is bourbon barrels impart a rather strong flavor and it takes a heck of a beer to stand up to that treatment. This particular beer is dark and nearly headless. A smack of tartness greets the nose initially and fades to a more vanilla-centric bourbon character. The flavor, too, is somewhat tart and cherry-like but really only mildly so. Again, the bourbon barrel character here is somewhat dominant w/ a bit of vanilla and some coconut. Whats missing I would say is much real porter character but, still, I would say this is much better than many other lighter barrel aged beers.

1234,"12oz bottle 4/16/10 (Binnys Naperville)-46 in English Pint-Pours dark brown almost black with some ruby tints and has ahuge tan head.

The caramel from the barrel is a very subdued secondary characteristic. An added dimension comes in from a generous addition of smoke and ash, pleasantly roasty, not burnt. Full bodied, but refreshing in spite of its weight. Nice beer.

1271,"(22 oz bottle: Obtained 23-Sep-05 in trade with atpayne, thanks Adam!) A loud ""pffft"" and explosive head had me worried right out of the gate that I let this possibly infected beer age too long, but this is a very delicious beer.  Moderate roast and light chocolate are enhanced by a pleasant earthy and mushroom flavor early, but also by the wonderful, sweet bourbon character throughout.  I think the bourbon is done perfectly here; its prominent but not dominant and nowhere close to being overwhelming, allowing the roast and other malty flavors plenty of opportunity to express themselves.  A little more roastiness wouldnt hurt though.  The nose is less impressive though because the roast is quite light, and the pleasantness of the moderate bourbon aroma is offset by a slight smell of apple skins.  Body is medium-full and far less carbonated than I expected given the glassful of head I got on the pour.  Dark brown in color with all sorts of tan specs slowly settling to the bottom of the glass.  Each pour results in mostly a glass of head, so it takes several pours to finish this beer, and even on the final pour, the head is unrelenting.  Tan in color, becoming mountainous with peaks and valleys as it begins to slowly settle down to a centimeter in height.  Thick, chunky foam sticks to the glass.  Except for the annoying carbonation issues and the modest apple skin in the aroma and flavor, this is a very enjoyable and tasty bourbon beer.

Finishes with a touch of tartness from the citrusy lemons and a very light straw bitterness. Somewhat dry with a medium length aftertaste following a light, smooth, clean body and light carbonation. Overall, a decent wheat beer. Definitely refreshing and easy drinking, but nothing special. This would be okay on a blazing hot day.

1297,"Bottle from StFun, thanks Josh.  Pours a very hazy yellow with a medium white head.  Hay, off putting esters, old yeast.  Medium bodied, very nice light carbonation, but not much going on in the flavor department.  Finishes with a little bit of wheat.  Not so good.
",1
1298,"Bottle.  Poured a two finger width, creamy white head.  Very nice deep golden color with a hazy body and attractive clouds of yeast.  The aroma is nice, but lacking - some wheat malt, a bit of bready yeastiness, but not much else.  The flavor is again light on wheat, a touch of spice and a bit of hay as I exhaled.  Slightly sweet finish with some mild bitterness.  I really like the body - medium, creamy, but soft carbonation.  Overall a decent wheat - its strongest suits are the appearance and palate.  A different yeast would probably do wonders for the aroma and flavor - more phenols and esthers would be a good contribution.

1300,"(10/14/08) Bottle (thanks a lot archmik for this bottle!) sampled at my hostel room in Chicago. Hazy golden. Aroma of fruits, some wheat and hints of citrus. Sweetish wheaty flavor with fruits. Light-bodied.

1301,"Metallic stale aroma and flavor that needs to be fairly cold to satisfy, light golden color with a minimal amount of wheat suspended, okay flavor that tastes a bit like cereal and stays on your tongue, overall its not bad on a summer day, but not really that good either
",1
1302,"Pretty flat for a wheat. Just not much going on. A few spice notes and some light citrus going on here, but nothing much that grabbed my attention. Might be good for someone who liked this style though!

1304,"A nice summertime brew, pours a bright golden body with a small head that quickly dissipates. The little foam leaves tiny laced mazes all down your glass. a hint of lemon and a somewhat grainy flavor. On the label is a picture of a dude with a Flatop hairdo riding in a car.
",1
1305,"bottle - Pours mostly clear gold with a one finger white head.  It has a light, citrus accented aroma.  The flavor is light and sweet with lots of citrus.  Theres definitely some lemony flavor in there.  Theres nothing particularly impressive here, but this beer tastes alright and is very refreshing.    It probably helped that I drank it on a warm, sunny afternoon.

1306,"Courtesy of stfun.  Pours a slightly hazy gold with a white head.  Smells citrussy with some wheat undertones.  Tastes of lemons with some perfume and touches of wheat.

1307,"Bottle. A very slightly opaque gold with a bright white head. The aroma has some notes of wheat bread and almonds. There is not much else going on in the nose. The taste has some light notes of pears and tomato soup. Bland and boring, not as bad as many American Wheats, with a hint of lemon zest in the finish.

1309,"12oz bottle poured in a specialy glass.  BIFBW (FT) pours clear and yellow like a macro-brew.  The head is very thin and short-lasting.  The nose consists of bubble gum and pears.

1310,"Dull, flat, faint lemon aroma.  Clear, golden with a thin head.  Very mild flavours with a hint of lemon-wheat.  Zesty, carbonated, and quite boring.

1311,"This was really a disappointing beer, especially when it advertises itself as a wheat. AThere was little, if anything, that reminded me of a wheat, and it will be easier to mejntion what it lacked, than what it had (which wasnt much).		There was no hazy color; no dough/wheat/spice in the aroma or flavor; no spicy/tingly mouthfeel; and no chewy/thirst quenching finish.		In short...it was like a BMC attempt to branch out to wheat. Shame on you B.I.
",1
1312,"Not a big fan of wheat beers.  Exception is Gumballhead but thats because it is over-hopped into an IPAish wheat beer.  This didnt have that advantage.  Golden body with small white head gave off aroma of breakfast cereal and orange juice.  Weak and watery and totally forgettable.
",1
1313,"A 12-oz bottle shared by joebrew. Pours a golden pale blonde brew with a thin off-white head that dissolves to a fine film. Aroma of sweet corn, a touch of wheat and straw hops. Taste is lightly carbonation, medium body with loight wheat taste. No yeast flavor or even in the aftertaste. The palate is tingly on tongue with a smooth and thin character. Finish is clean cut, with a slight sweet aftertaste. A unique wheat beer that is more like a multi-grain with a lager character.
",1
1314,"This would probably be a very drinkable beer with a slice of lemon but why should that be needed?  Without the slice this is disappointing and even a little boring.  The aroma is not enticing, the flavor is weak, and it feels thin in the mouth.  A wheat beer should be so much better than this offering.
",1
1315,"Bottle. Pours hazy gold/yellow. Thin white head. Notes of dry yeast on the nose. Very nondescript. Same for the flavor profile. Minimal hops, malt and yeast. Just a slight step above your average BMC product. Sessionable but virtually flavorless.
",1
1316,"From a 12 oz. bottle with no freshness date, sampled at cellar temperature in a pint glass, without, then with the recommended slice of lemon.		Poured a clear pale yellowish golden with a foamy white head, decent retention, slowly settled into a thin sudsy lacing.		The aroma without the lemon slice was very wheat malty, a light spiciness and a subtle fruitiness, with lemon slice, lemony, of course, the yeast comes out a bit, and the malts turn a little fruit wheat bready, kinda of appealing.		Good carbonation, tiny micro bubbles flowing from bottom to top for the whole duration, and a soft malty crisp, dry, creamy smooth medium-light bodied mouthfeel, when add the lemon slice it helps the crispiness and adds a little acidity.		The taste without the lemon slice, wheat malty with a mildly tart peach fruitiness, a touch of spiciness, with the slice of lemon, lemon fruity with a mild citric acidity, the malts turn wheat bready with a soft spiciness, the mild tart peach fruitiness is tamed even more, and a dry lemony, fruity, bready finish. The slice of lemon adds to the taste and I see why the brewer recommends it, an easy, smooth drinker on a hot, muggy late spring day.		I would just like to add that I dont think it is a ""crime"" or ""sin"" to a add a slice of lemon or orange to a pale wheat ale or witbier, especially when that is the brewers intent.

1318,"UPDATED: MAY 31, 2007 Drinking from a bottle of Flat Top:  This pours a slightly hazed pale yellow body with a dinkus fizzy head that dematerializes rather quickly.  It smells of Wheaties, old straw, and a squirt of lemon juice.  Highly carbonated and spritzy in the mouth, it tastes like wheat flakes, dried grass, and lemon.

1319,"Wow, I dont understand the hate on this beer - seems to me to be a good light summer beer.  Pours very pale yellow tih a fluffy and fizzy off-white head.  The aroma has sweet american style wheat graininess, a bit of spice, light paper aspects and some lemony citrus.  Medium / thin body that is smooth and pleasant with extra sharp carbonation on the finish.  The flavors start with some spice with some mellow wheat, grain, grassiness and light nectarine.  The finish has spicy hops and a bit of lemony citrus.    Nothing that will knock your socks off, but a nice light enjoyable summer beer.

1320,"Bottle.  Light yeasty aroma with some sour vacuum cleaner.  Clear golden with a white head.  Lightly bitter, lightly wheaten taste.  Medium body with a trickle of carbonation.  Doesnt really have any character or style features - on the order of BMC, but with fewer headaches.  Not a lot here!

",1
1325,"From a sampler: This brew is a slightly hazy amber-orange color with a thin off-white head. Some lacing is evident. The aroma is light and wheaty. Light-bodied with equal parts hops and wheat in the flavor. This seems more like a light Lager than a Wheat. The finish is mildly hoppy. I can see this as being a gateway beer.

1326,"Starchy, as described by flemdawg. No balance, just a lot of yeast notes that lacked any hints of fruitiness. Watery body lacked any sign of malt flavor. Odd.
",1
1327,"BIG Oktoberfest: Not a fan of this one.  Everything about the beer screamed wheat.  The color was that of wheat, as was the aroma.  The taste was, as a friend put it, like sucking on a piece of wheat.  If I wanted to do that, I would move to Iowa.
",1
1328,"This brew poured a medium head offinely sized mostly lasting bubbles that left a fair lacing and a transparent carbonated golden colored body behind.  It had a smooth bubbly mouthfeel.  This brew did not taste like a wheat beer to me.  It was much more thin on it flavor with notes of bread and it was slightly acidic.  Its weak mouthfeel made it seem more like a soda pop/

1329,"First of all, this did not taste anything like a Wheat beer as it tasted more like a Lager.The head was white, small sized with fine sized bubbles.The body was clear with carbonation and the hue was yellow.The flavor was bitter, sour and somewhat tart.The mouthfeel was tingly on my tongue and it was smooth and thin.

1331,"Bottle. Poured a clear copper color with an off white head. Smelled of date, clove, subdued flowery hop, anise, and cereal grain. There was also a whiff of mint. Light to medium bodied and dry. I tasted mixed spices, light pine, anise, and a bit of oak.

1332,"22 oz bomber from Josh.  Deep, dark brown color with a slight tan head.  Very subtle aromas, slightly hoppy with a touch of dark fruit.  Difficult to pick out much from the aroma.  Flavor is also very subtle which made it very hard to pick out exact notes, more hops with some dark fruit.  The finish had a touch of oakiness to it but  is what made things more difficult because it was very dry and made the flavors disappear very quickly.  Interesting and unique beer but was just tough to break down for us.
",1
1333,"Its aight.  Crushed with a couple of mos.  Lots of dark fruit notes as a good quad should have.  Interesting hops in the finish are both strange, disconcerting, yet somewhat pleasant.  Barrel adds another interesting sweetness to the brew.  Cant put my finger on what I think about this one, but its interesting, original, and drinkable.  Cool.

1334,"Bottle thanks to thirdeye11. The color of the beer is brown and it has a beige colored head.  The smell is hops, fresh hops, fruits, malts, and alcohol.  The  taste is hops, fruits, and ok.
",5
1335,"Perfectly black with a thin light khaki head. Malty milk chocolate with some nice sweet oranges. There is also some nice fruity cherry. Chocolate covered cherries dominate the initial taste with some cola following up. There is a hint of wood and roast, but it plays in the background. Overall, it is easy to drink and very malty as I got very little hops. Fun to drink and a pleasant surprise. This is in no way a quad, it is a Strong Ale.

1336,"(22oz bottle thanks to RedHaze) Pours clear dark brown with oily bubbles on top. Nose of brown sugar, pine hops. Taste of toasted sugar, pine hops, more bitter than I expected. Nice sweet balance with a creamy finish. Didnt really taste like a quad to me, but still enjoyable.

Second bottle rate (maybe it didnt make the transition from kegs to bottles well on this batch).

1342,"22 ounce thanks to Wes. Not too much carbonation. Bit of sweetness and malt mixed. Hops are battling that malt profile. Some oak. Interesting but slightly different kind of Quad. Not sure what to make of it yet.

1345,"UPDATED: OCT 16, 2009 On tap at the 2009 Crescent Moon Extreme Beer Festival. OK kids. This is something very special. Pours a dark mahogany color with a thick large dark beige head. The head retention is out of this world. This has the aroma of a barleywine except theres also lots of chocolate and oak scents in there as well due to the barrel aging. The flavor has big fruits and vanilla. Very pronounced wine from the chardonnay barrels. In spite of all these complex and roudy flavors, this is surprisingly smooth and easy to drink. An astonishingly good beer. UPDATE 10/2009: This beer is no longer named ""Concentrated Evil"" but will now be known as ""Certified Evil."" It will appear in bottles in the Omaha market in November of 2009.

1352,"FINALLY!!! A great locally bottled non-brewpub beer that I can make my regular tap. On tap at the Crescent Moon beginning in December of 2009. I hope to enjoy this for a long time. This is actually a bit better than SN Celebration. Incredible pine and cedar and fresh cut grass to the aroma. Rich and deep scent that is simply a delight to inhale. The flavor is big for a single IPA. Lots of grapefruit citrus and green hop taste, but also has the malt sweetness to the body to pull all this off successfully. This IPA can totally hold its own against many of the California Big Boys. And for me, the carbon footprint is low! Zack has hit another home run with this one. I hope the recipe does not get ""tweaked!""
",5
1353,"Delicious IPA, a cause for rejoicing. Amber color. Beautiful hoppy aroma, excellent malt balance to back the hops, flavor includes distinctive Amarillo hops plus both floral and grassy hops. A beer Nebraskans can drink with pride and worth a roadtrip down I-80 for the rest of the world

1354,"12 oz bottle from Pepsican. Nose is light citrus and very grassy, earthy hops mixed with a little malt backbone. Cloudy amber orange with a big lightly lacing beige head. Flavor is bitter with bits of lemon and grass along with a hint of coffee in the background.

1356,"12 ounce bottle.  Pours a hazy amber with a large off-white head.  Aroma of piney hops and citrus.  Taste is piney hops, floral hops, citrus, and some malt.  Good balance.  Nice.
",5
1357,"Dripping with resinous hops, this IPA packs a surprisingly bitter punch, wringing every last west coast IBU from the recipe.  The malts give a grainy, meek background, one barely noticeable in the face of such massive piney massiveness.  Good nose, even with a hint of metallic ick.  The texture isnt that great-- the beer seems overcarbonated and spiky, too harsh when coupled with a sandpaper-dry finish.  Good but one is plenty.
",5
1358,"Hazy amber with a medium brown head.  Aroma of pale malt, citrus, resinous, earthy and danky hops.  Taste is earthy with moderately sweet pale malt, citrus, bready malt and mild bitterness.
",5
1359,"Bottled sample. Clear copper in colour with fairly strong carbonation. PIne lumber upfront in the nose, backed by sme white grapefruit, nutty malts and faint caramel. More pine wood in the mouth, but it takes on an additional sap quality as well. White grapefruit shows up a bit more here too. Solid chunky black pepper bitterness. I didnt get a whole lot of Amarillo notes out of this beer, but Cascade and Centennial are here in spades. A solid (somewhat safe) IPA overall. Good.

The palate is medium bodied, dry resinous finish. Nice one.

1369,"I strongly suspected this beer was snazzy marketing from a shifty deep pockets startup or a macro brewer in disguise--which it may be.		This beer is a wonderful rich mouthfeel and equally balanced hop attack of a mild astringent, citrus, and light fruit. The hops are strong and balanced. It is very good, a well done beer with a nice deep color. 		I strongly suggest picking up a sixer. BUT, dont confuse the IPA and the Lager (green vs. orange pkg.) The lager is almost undrinkable. Just awful.

1370,"[Bottle] Pours a clear orange color with a white foamy nose and great looking lacing. Big and hoppy nose provides tropical fruit, heavy pine and some orange zest notes.

A nicely done IPA.

1374,"6 pack from BBM. This is a good looking beer: deep orange with a perfectly formed white head. Hops are quite obvious in the aroma, but not necessarily intense. Its floral with grapefruit and some evergreen as well. The hoppiness is more pronounced in the flavor. Lucky Bucket has made a really nice, dry and hoppy brew.

Aromas are English IPA-like... lots of caramel malt, herbal hops, a little resin and spice.  Flavor is similar... I like the West Coast-style IPA description, but this is more of a hybrid between West Coast and England.  Flavor is OK... but again, its more herbal and spicy hops instead of citrus and resin.  Its good, but not quite as advertised.

1388,"Hazy amber orange, foamy beige head. Aroma is floral, orange, nut, toasty malt, grass, vine, fruit. Taste is nice and tropical, pine, orange peel. More flavor than I was expecting overall.
",1
1389,"Amber tone with white head.  Aroma is grapefruit and citrus.  Well balanced - not too hoppy and not too malty.  Nice bitter hop flavors, although not too strong.  A little sweet.  Heavy lacing.
",5
1390,"[Bottle] Pours deep amber with a small off-white head. Aroma is lemony, with some pine--not bad. The taste has an unusual spiciness, with some lemon zest, moderate bitterness, and barley in the finish. Decent mouthfeel, finish length is average to slightly below. An interesting IPA. Fairly well made, although the taste reminded me a little of the pink filling in some of the chocolates you find in the assorted chocolate packs around Valentines Day. Actually, all around my biggest complaint with this beer isnt execution, but just rather how the hops ended up playing out. Still, it seems like this brewery could turn out some good beer, so I look forward to trying their other offerings.
",5
1391,"Yellow/orange color, hazy with nice dense rocky off-white head.  Citrus nose with hint of malt mingled in.   Good start.   Green hop flavor, kind of muddled hop flavor upon first sip.   Malt profile is thin, this is focused on the hops but they are not clean and balanced which is disappointing given aroma and look in the glass.   Hop flavor is cloying and lingers around too long.   Not something Id order a second time.
",1
1392,"5/1/11. 12oz bottle from Cavie. Hazy orange pour with a huge off-white head that sticks and laces. Somewhat mild citrus aroma with hints of caramel malt. Decent malty flavor with a hint of salt and a touch of citrus and bitter hop.
",1
1393,"A somewhat mixed review. I liked it quite a bit, MB didnt so much. I liked the bitter finish on it, she thought it tasted a bit off. So who ya gonna listen to?
",1
1394,"Twist-off. Pours translucent dark gold. Smoothish, fluffy head that sticks nicely. A whiff of skunk in the nose--unusual for an IPA--complemented by something a bit unappetizing, arguably gueuze-like. Pretty hard carbonation. Not exactly the hop bitters you want--more like alcohol bitters. This definitely drinks hotter than 6.3%. Actually a pretty sweet beer. Not my style of IPA.
",1
1395,"A dark amber with a white head. Aroma contains some citrus and caramel. Flavor is a nice balance of malty and hoppy with some caramel and toffee mixed in with some oranges and grapefruit. This is still hop head friendly but offers more than just bitter. Good beer.
",5
1396,"Dry hop aroma, although faint.  Overall not that bad, but rather lacking compared to most other IPAs.
",1
1397,"Poured a nice orange amber hue with a white head that had nice lace and retention.  Aroma had a strong pine hop profile, some lingering grapefruit notes.   Caramel malts give the aroma a nice balance.  Initial flavor had a hop bite, leaning more towards the grapefruit aspects then pine, but the sweet caramel malts cut right through the bitter hops giving the beer a nice balance.  Finish was dry.  A nice IPA.  Came from the beer of the month club.
",5
1398,"Nose of grapefuit and pine. The citrus is dank and musky though, not bright. Flavor follows nose for the most part,  but less pine. Good malt in finish to provide balance. Finish is long with lingering bitterness. Overall, a nice American IPA.
",5
1399,"12 oz. bottle from grownfool- thanks again, Brian! Pours a cloudy amber color with a two-finger, frothy, rocky beige head. Aroma of citrusy and piney hops, grapefruit, caramel malts, perfume, and potpourri. Flavor of floral and citrusy hops, tea, grapefruit and orange citrus, caramel malts, and pine resin. Light-medium bodied, with medium carbonation and a bitter, resinous mouthfeel. Lingering bitterness. Solid IPA that actually drinks kind of like a double IPA.
",5
1400,"12 bottle in Pint Glass.  Citrus Aromoas with straw like malts.  dark yellow brown color.  white head.  High carbonation, slightly slick.  Some lingering bitterness.  Good citrus hop flavors.  Fairly well balanced.

1401,"Wow...nice beer.  Aromatic hops, off white head and heavy lacing.  The mouthfeel is soft and bitter and a little sticky.  I enjoy.

1402,"The Dan Journal #431. Tasted 12/14/10. 12oz bottle. Hazy and sedimented with a dark amber hue. Spotty bubbled tan head. Aromas of citrus hops and toasty malts. Medium bodied with a pleasant grapefruit hop bitterness. Solid citrus flavors and it adds to the effervescence. Subtle raisin note. Decent enough.
",1
1403,"Thanks ScottyP for the hook up on this one. Pretty darn good little IPA. Best sessionable big IPA that Ive had in awhile. Nice spice component. Very fresh hop flavors with a nice lingering bitterness. Decent malt balance. All in all a nice beer.
",5
1404,"Very dark maroon color, probably the darkest IPA Ive seen. The aroma is very fruity, not just citrus fruity, but berries. Flavor is the same, very sharp citrus/grapefruit bitterness with a very refreshing sour cherry and strawberry flavor. Palate is very long lasting ending with a great hop warmth. I miss this and wish i was drinking it right now. On tap at 12 South Taproom in Nashville, TN
",5
1405,"12oz bottle, no date to be found but assured to be fresh by the distributor.  Pours very hazy orange/amber with a large pillowy off-white head that leaves tree rings of lacing and maintains a persistent foamy cap.  Aroma is strong on citrus rind and pine, oranges, pineapple, some grassy and floral notes, a bit of caramel malt.  Good to very good strength.  Flavor is citrus rind, resinous hops, pine, good caramel malt backbone with mild sweetness, finishes with good lingering bitterness.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily, medium to high carbonation.  An excellent IPA with all the qualities that I love...hazy, pungent, bitter.  I impressed.
",5
1406,"UPDATED: FEB 26, 2011 12 oz. Darkish copper with a humongous head even with a soft pour. Nose is big caramel, resin, and citrus. Flavor is caramel, resin, wood and orange baby aspirin. Light-medium body is smooth and watery. Another two-note blast of West Coast hops. Nothing new, and nearly well-done.
",1
1407,"12 oz bottle. Pours cloudy at first and then clears to new copper penny with a nice fluffy white head. Huge citrus hop nose. Taste is a nice citrus hop profile with lingering bitterness on the end. Alcohol is present but not overwhelming.  Not much malt profile. A good drinking sessionable IPA.
",5
1408,"UPDATED: FEB 13, 2011 Had both draft and bottle, liked em both. Coppery orange, big rocky white head. Smells nice - hoppy, of course, a nice mix of citrus and pine, plus a subtle peppery note. Flavor is earthy and rough around the edges. Long aftertaste. Some peppery notes, too. Nice session IPA, even at 6.3%.
",5
1409,"Dark caramel orange, whitish cover.  Aroma is citrus, orange, grapefruit, and some caraml malt.  Taste is grapefruit, caramel, light grassy spiciness mixed with a moderate bitter finish.  Nice stuff.

1410,"Draft, pours hazy amber with off white head. Nose has fruity notes, melon and juicy fruit. Flavors balance sweet caramel malts with juicy fruit and orange. Touch sweeter than I want in an ipa but drinkable.
",5
1411,"UPDATED: DEC 20, 2010 Bottle courtesy drfabulous. Pours a clear reddish color with a white bubbly head. Aroma is fresh hops with slight sappy nose. Flavor is sharp hops with a very dry and bitter finish.
",1
1412,"Bottle from Cavie.  Orange brown pour with a small white head.  Aroma is earthy, caramel, and a little citrus.  Taste is bread, hops, very bitter, and caramel.
",1
1413,"Deep copper colored and slightly ruby at the edges. There is also a long lasting head with a light khaki color. The nose has some strong grapefruit along with crystal malt type character. There is some toffee and a little bit of glazed donut. The taste has some strong grapefruit with some sweet hints. The finish is dry and woody with a little bit of grass. This starts out nice, but the finish is just ok, I would like a sweeter balance. Decent.
",5
1414,"Pours a deep orange, almost a red color with a big head and lots of lace. The aroma is plenty of grassy hops with a touch of citrus and pine with a bit of fruity malt in the back ground. The flavor is dry and grassy, very bitter, actually a bit brash and has an overwhelming character of that strong orange rind bitterness. The palate is a bit thin.  A little more balance on the hops and I would like this beer a lot.
",5
1415,"12 oz bottle		A generous bonus from a friendly trader I drank this on a quiet evening when there wasnt time for a heavier beer or something in a larger format. A bit more than your basic lawnmower beer this is an assertive IPA. Its not quite up there with the best of the best but I can imagine regionally that it is one of the better choices.		Aroma / Appearance - Coppery brown with a dirty white head the body was what youd imagine a solid IPA to be. Aged cedar planks stand out in a mixture of hops and malt that is not quite the strongest West Coast but certainly in the ballpark. Actually it comes across as a bit tame.		Flavor / Palate - Heavy malt alerts the palate that this is not your average pale ale. Tasting like someone watered down planks of maple it transitions in the end to a resiny pine cone. The mouthfeel is thick enough to almost be cloying for the style but stops just short of the line. This was solid but doesnt make me want to put much effort into stocking up on more Nebraska pale ales.
",5
1416,"12 ounce shorty bottle.  Lucky Bucket IPA is robust in color, moving from dark amber to red.  My initial impression of the nose is that it gives a pretty solid aroma of piney hops, though it fades quickly.  Moderate amount of lacing and about a half finger of foam.  Sticky lacing continues down the glass.  Theres a hefty amount of bitterness and a nice piney bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is pretty heavy,  but it could use more body.  Theres light cereal sweetness is up front, with grapefruit and citrus in the middle, followed by those piney hops..  Obviously, this is a pine bomb.  The beer could benefit from some more malt sweetness, but overall I like it.
",1
1417,"Rich amber pour with a whitish head that disappeared remarkably fast. Sour oranges, grapefruit, resiny aroma.  Flavor has some great citrus peel bitterness, earthy hops, light honeyed malt flavor.  Very good beer.
",5
1418,"Nose has notes of caramel malts, floral hops, light tropical fruit, a hint of iced tea, and light citrus. Pours copper with a nice frothy white head and sticky lace. The flavor has notes of caramel, iced tea, tropical fruit, citrus and a pleasant floral finish. Nice and dry, light sticky resins. Well made.
",5
1419,"I attended the 1st annual Beer-b-que yesterday.  The IPA was very good, and amazingly full.  I could definitely taste the caramel in this on.  I am more of a citrus guy when it comes to IPA, but it still was very good.  It made there lager taste pretty weak.  I had a great time by the way, could you throw something like that more than once a year.  I was a little disappointed they didnt have certified evil available.

1420,"2010 Bottle - Pours a clear coppery amber with a large beige head...aroma is bright, tons of caramel and citrus, pithy and malty...flavour is almost as good, decently bitter, dry malt and bread, grapefruit peel and resin...definitely a nice rendition of a west coast IPA...

1426,"On tap at the Crescent moon. Pours light amber with an off-white head and very large carbonation bubbles. Muted grainy aroma. The flavor is very much like the pre-prohibition lager except it has a fruity element to it. Finishes with a harsh aftertaste very reminiscent of the pre-prohibition lager.

1427,"sample from the pitcher @ GABF on 9/18/10.  dark black pour with a 1 finger tan head.  sweet malts aromas.  medium body with light malts.  roasted finish with some dark fruits.  overall a very sweet baltic porter and a bit off IMO.

",5
1430,"On tap at GABF 2011. Pours a brown dark amber color, totally opaque. A huge funky fruity nose, lots of tart sawdust and cherries, some vinous notes. The flavor was a awesome and surprising burst of cherries, very tart, some sweetness comes through, wood, light lactic notes, very much a full flavored fruit sour (I realize it is also correctly viewed as a lambic). A low but lively body.
",5
1431,"Picked up a sixpack of this lager before the holiday weekend.  Poured a nice copper color with a nice level of head and carbonation. So far so good. 		The taste was sour, not terribly overwhelmingly sour but enough to question if I had gotten a bad bottle. I tried another bottle the following night -it was also bad. 		I contacted the brewery to ask about the off flavors. According to the brewery rep, sour is not an intended flavor in this beer! They offered to replace the six pack free of charge if I was in the area, and that they would like to investigate the problem. MN to NE is a little far to go for a sixer but the effort on the breweries part to correct the problem was promising. I did provide the bar code on the bottle so they could track the batch with their own records and hopefully determine what went wrong. Id like to try a fresh example someday.

1432,"Tap - small foamy head, medium amber color, very swet malty aroma and flavor
",1
1433,"12 oz. Clear copper with a lasting half-inch of creamy meringue above. Aroma of corn, dark toasted nut, and earthy root vegetables. Flavor is deep roasted walnut, toffee, lightly sour citrus and earthy roasted root vegetable. Medium body has average carbonation and is dry with roast and hops.

1434,"Bottle. Clear orangish pour with a decent sized white head. Aroma and taste are not very good, actually - vegetables, grain, minimal malt character, hops dont stand out. Bleh.
",1
1435,"Draft at GABF. I was very excited when I saw this one, just because you dont see many pre-pro lagers out there. Pours a gold with stiff white head. Nose is vegetal, cabbage and maize. Some faint herbal hop notes come through, but the DMS is a bit offputting. On tasting, its a bit cleaner, but still vegetal with maize being a driving component. Bitterness works but the hops that they are proud of seems really restrained. I dunno, maybe a bad batch?
",1
1436,"(12oz bottle thanks to Cavie) clear amber, effervescent in the glass, ring of off-white head. Nose is very sweet, oddly a bit tart, and raw grain. Taste is also a bit tart, orange, lacking in flavor overall, but some buttery components here also. Thin body and thin on palate flavor, well carbonated though.

1437,"A clear golden orange beer with a small white head.  The aroma is malt, corn, and grass.  The flavor is slightly sweet corn and fruity hops.  Very thin body, not a terrible lager.

1443,"[Bottle] Pours a clear orange color with a nice cap of beige head. Sweet molasses and caramel nose. Some grainy notes in there as well. Moderately malty taste includes a bit of citrus and mild hoppy finish. Light metal, but overall it tasted pretty clean. Average mouthfeel/palate. I didnt think this was too bad. I actually think it would make a good transition beer for people that arent into craft beer.
",1
1444,"Bottle, smallish head, murky darkish orange colour, funky aroma of sour cabbage and sewer, strong overpowering vinrgar flavour leaving nothing behind. This brew is infected, real shame i dont have another one to try.
",1
1445,"12oz. bottle. Hey,my Dads catching on, hes putting stuff like this in his fridge. Ive learned that Pre-Pro beers were first to use corn as an adjunct, but this one is all malt. And the malt shows up in the nose and taste. Light brown color of a Pre-Pilsener, too, reminded me of a Yuengling. Full on malt taste, with the spice of mainly German hops, followed by those piny American types. I may be rating this higher than others, but I think this is a fine ""common"" lager with no flaws.

Aroma has some sour fruits, corny notes, some slightly citric hops notes and a decent malt character, a bit bready, with some graininess.

1449,"Gold w/ white head.  Grassy hop aroma.  Pretty mediocre pale lager.  Nothing too special...although its better than any macro.  Notes of barley malt, grassy hops and something like black pepper on the finish.  It is what it is...a easy drinking clean lager.  Ok everyday drinking brew. Wont buy again though...there are P.L.s I enjoy more.

",1
1458,"Boston Lager glass from twist-off bottle. Pours somewhere between amber and gold. Thin head. Aroma is faint. Good grain flavor, minimal hop character (for both aroma and flavor); mostly sweet flavors of chocolate and nuts. Kind of like a watered-down amber lager. Weak body. This is easy to drink, from a mouthfeel/viscosity standpoint, but lacking in the fullness quality that the best session lagers have. It honestly seems like its been diluted.

",1
1461,"Darker gold with white head and visible carbonation.   Malty nose but I also smell something akin to rotten fruit (very very faint), or could it be a Bret influence?.   There is a toasty malt flavor, almost dry flavor upon first taste.   Its almost smokey and a bit odd, although I can appreciate this unique twist.   Some citrus/lemon flavor (the hops?).   Doesnt really go together but separate it makes an interesting experience.  Given you dont drink flavors in silos I find this a bit of a confusing beer.   Upon further tasting, this really does seem to have a bit of a sour Bret side to it.  Not sure what to make of that interpretation.

1462,"12oz bottle pours a clear orange with a white film of a head. Aroma of corn, grain, caramel, and a slight sourness and hop. Taste has some up front malty sweetness that turns into bitter yeast flavors, with hints of hops throughout. Interesting and very decent Lager.

1463,"5/1/11. 12oz bottle courtesy Cavie! Hazy orange pour with a small off-white head that fades to a ring fast. Light aroma of caramel and a hint of sour corn. Smooth, malty flavor that lingers sour a bit as well. Interesting, not bad.
",1
1464,"Poured a clear light brown color with a white head that faded quickly.  Aroma had a toasted grain and caramel note to it.  Flavor had a little more of bread like notes and some sweetness to it almost like brown sugar.  Body seemed a little thin, but not enough to totally ruin the beer.  Evenly balanced and smooth. A nice beer.

1465,"Pours a clear bright gold/amber with an OK white head that laces the glass some.  Sweet malt and hop bouquet.  Taste is sweet pale malt, bisquits and a light hoppiness.  Refreshing and quite good.
",1
1466,"Bottle from Frugal MacDoogal. Pours pale amber with a dissipating ivory head. Aroma of cereal and fruity esters. Light bodied with average carbonation, and perhaps a little watery in texture. Very pale malt backbone that is a mix of caramel, pils, and toasted malts. Subtle but detectable hop bitterness brings this into balance. Actually a decent beer to pair with hearty food when you want to go lighter. By itself, not so exciting.

1478,"12oz bottle - 		Aroma - very hard to pick-up any major aromas.  Light malty grain, a little sulfur and a touch of apple juice.		Appearance - solid gold body, clear with sporadic bubbles coming up from the bottle.  Head starts out about 3/4"" thick, disipates to just a splatch of nothing really.		Taste - flavor is really clean, not much to hang your hat on.  Kinda minerally tasting, light grass and a touch of sweet malt		Palate - light bodied, light carbonation...has a seltzer water kinda feel to it		Overall - a really nice standard lager.

1492,"UPDATED: AUG 20, 2009 On tap @ the Crescent Moon.  Clear amber with a small off-white head, fading to a film before long.  Aroma of some toasted malts and old citrus hops.  The flavor is fairly biscuity with a little caramel malts.  Some citrusy hops are around as well.    The finish is semi-dry with bitterness around a 3.  Light prickly carbonation with a light body.  For a pale lager, this isnt bad at all.  Also, not bad for a flagship beer.  If I lived in Omaha, though, Id pick most Boulevard beers over this as a go-to beer, for probably less money as well.
",1
1493,"On tap at the Crescent Moon. Pours a dark straw color with a medium bright white head. This might have been Storz reborn, except that it lacks the corn and has an unexpected dry hopping finish. Not a smooth beer, but definitely has a manly grainy flavor. Mild citrus tartness is an undercurrent. A good tailgate beer I suppose.

1494,"(Draught)  Pours a clear golden body with a medium white head.  Aroma of herbs, horseblanket, and grass.  Flavor of brett, light citrus, pedio, and earthiness with a dry finish.

1495,"on tap @GABF-pours mahogany with a light brown head.  Aroma is smoke/peat/roasty-medium/dark malt.  Taste is smoke/peat/roasty-medium/dark malt, earthy hops.

1496,"12 ounce bottle, little stamp on the bottom of the 4-pack container says best if used by 7 15 12.  Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown with about a half inch tan head that went away quickly.  Theres a decent amount of lacing.  Aroma is weak (but nice), the beer smells like dark fruit, molasses, and a bit of coffee and chocolate.  The brew tastes like dark fruit (figs), red wine, roasted malt, coffee, dark fruit and a little bit of honey and tart berries.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its creamy and coating and is well carbonated.  The soft carbonation makes it easy enough to drink.  The longer I drank this, the more and more I liked it.  Worth a try.
",5
1497,"we sampled from 2 bottles which were substantially different from each other. Overall, poured with a large, tan, thick, foamy, frothy head and loads of lace. Color is an opaque black brown. Flavor falls down some, tart on top with some toasty malt, dark ripe fruit, yeast, molasses. Body has some high points that dont fit, carbonation is ok. Finish is like flavor, on the short side, no hint at all of alcohol.
",1
1498,"Tasted on 12/20/11 from a 12oz bottle, thank you to Jane.  Pours a completely opaque black with a very thick and rocky tan head that slowly recedes to thin, but rocky lace.  The nose is full of darkly roasted malt and coffee, but also has a very nutty, buttered popcorn, and oaky cinnamon aroma.  The flavor is vinous and fruity up front, moving to the cinnamon and vanilla oak, and finishing with the very darkly roasted, and lightly bitter coffee malt.  The body is full with average, but very smooth carbonation, and a long, vinous, and freshly roasted, lightly bitter coffee finish.
",5
1499,"Dark brown with red edges and a nice dark milk chocolate colored loose foam.  Aroma is very nice, molasses, burnt sugar, coffee, loads of bitter chocolate, faint oak and red wine, holy shit this is lovely.  The taste is different but still fantastic, the red wine is more forward, light oaky dryness, and finishes with sugar, and a light roast.  I must get more beers aged in red wine barrels.
",5
1500,"A dark beer. Lots of chocolate and dark fruit flavors. A little bit of spice. Complex but very easy to drink so if you slam this beer you might miss out on a lot of the different flavors.
",5
1501,"Botttle to tulip. Deep dark pour with tan head. Notes of toastiness and sweetness. Heavy bodied. A very interesting beer. I enjoy this one a lot. I definitely have a few four packs aging in my cellar. Very excited about that. Its pretty complex, but it seems to work very well. I love that it was aged in cabernet barrels. They impart unique qualities to it.
",5
1502,"Murky Brown with small brown head.  Strong vineous syrupy sour aroma.  Wow, very unique taste.  That vineous sour aroma transfers to the taste.  Taste is red wine and dark fruit balanced by sweet malt and some hops.  The wine flavor is a bit sharp.  Also notes of brown sugar, caramel, sour apple and honey.  Complex...VERY.  This is one of the craziest beers Ive ever had.  With every sip I like it more, but couldnt --wouldnt want to drink more than one.
",1
1503,"Berries/grapes in the aroma, odd for this style, although not quite for what it was aged in.  The flavor is dominated by the berries/grapes with some decent maltiness thrown in.  Although it might be good further down the road if aged, this had far too much berries/grapes for this style, it dominated the flavor and it should have been more subtle.
",1
1504,"A dark, dark, really dark beer. Big head, audacious to look at. Aroma is odd and unexpected in a fantastic, wine forward way. First hit on the palate is very much wine, fruity, tart, and somewhat tannic.  After  few seconds, the rich choclate and toffee of the beer comes forward with just a slightly bitter finish. Definite sipper.
",5
1505,"12 oz bottle. Pours stark black with small beige head. The aroma is vinous and thick with dark fruit and raisin at first pour, but after it breathes for a minute it gives way to a more ashy and roasty character, maybe even a hint of smoke, and some spice and licorice. The flavor is burnt toast and lots of barrel. Im surprised by the amount of ashy bitterness in this. It was a little offputting at first, but its growing on me. The finish is dry but has some raisin notes to it. Not too shabby.
",5
1506,"Bottle Murky dark brown ale with a tiny, creamy, off-white head. Decent retention. The nose is roasty and spicy with a bounty of aromatic hops and a dash of anise. Medium-bodied and milky with laid-back carbonation. The flavor presents dark fruits, toasted malt and some spiciness. Plenty of hop flavor without the messy bitterness and mildly tart. Finishes tangy, lightly spicy and roasty. Bottle courtesy of illinismitty!
",1
1507,"[Bottle] Pours dark brown with a big light tan head. Aroma is sweet, with some light milk chocolate (kind of like a whopper), honey, and some odd vegetative notes that are a little grassy. Taste is interesting--raisin, spices (I assume cardamom?), alcohol, chocolate, quite sweet, but underlying roasted malt and some oak. Honey notes in the finish. A little too much of the ashy roasted malt towards the end, but not completely overdone like with many porters and stouts these days. Good mouthfeel, long finish. Overall, I a little split about this beer. It was interesting, I enjoyed it, especially at times. However, it was fairly busy and muddled, and I feel like some things could have been left out.
",5
1508,"Pours black, opaque, medium tan head. Aroma is quite interesting, sweet raisins, winey, chocolate, oak. Its lovely.  Creamy, slick, moderate carbonation. The flavor falls flat though. Sweetness up front is followed by a completely muddled strong porter middle and a bitter, slightly sour, very stale finish. I think this ones a drain pour. Bad bottle? Bad beer? Not sure. Not enjoyable, regardless.
",1
1509,"12 oz bottle pours dark brown with a 2 finger quick disappearing head.  The raisins raise up in the aroma, along with cookie dough, oak, and toasted bread. Flavor is dark roasts and malt, along with oak from the cabernet. Full bodied.

1510,"Pours a clear, dark brown with a thin tan head. Aroma is roasted malt, nuts, chocolate, and caramel. Malty, roasty flavor with chocolate, caramel, nuts, dark fruits, and molasses. Medium body with medium carbonation and alcohol masked nicely. Not bad.
",5
1511,"Dark ruby black pour with a light brown head.  Aroma was raisins, pennies, dark fruit and vinegar.  Flavor was almost nothing but oxidization and pennies.  I think this beer had tremendous potential and was done a great disservice by being put into twist off bottles.  Give me a cage and cork bottle of this to sit on for a few years and it has great potential to be exciting.

1514,"Bottle. Very dark pour with a foamy cream colored head. Awesome aroma of roast, smoke, some sweetness, and a little bit of dark fruit (probably from the wine barrel aging).

1515,"12 0z bottle traded with Mr. Bishop from Tenn opened into a sniffer in San 	diego.  looks near black with brownish corners.  light brown 2 finger tiny bubble head.  smells interesting i think in a good way.  smells very lightly like mocha with a bit of bbq complexity.  Tastes like a typical porter with some roastiness and decently thick dark malts.  I cant put my finger on the exact interesting difference in this beer.  Still a pretty good beer but not an imperial porter in my opinion.  Overall 6.5 of 10.

1518,"Thanks to fata2683 for this one in trade.  Pours a cinnamon brown color with an off-tan head.  Nose is cinnamon, spices, slight peppercorn, brown sugar, a hint of citrus, and a bit of booze.

1521,"Bottle to snifter. Pours thin dark brown with a big soapy kahki head. Aroma is bitter dark fruit and roasted burnt malt. Taste is more burnt malt and dark fruit plums and soy. Palate is medium and very fizzy with a chaulky finish. For a strong porter I felt it was lacking creaminess and chocolate malt. Pretty bitter though!
",1
1522,"[Bottle] Pours a very dark brown color with no meaningful head. Nose is of dark malts, red wine, raisins and residual alcohol. Molasses, coffee beans, vanilla, chocolate and heavy raisin and plum notes in the taste. Reminded me of Port in some ways. Sweet red wine finish. Nicely masked alcohol. Syrupy. Kind of a weird brew actually. I liked it at the end, but it had to grow on me.

",5
1525,"bottle courtesy of tyler, thanks homie! definitely an interesting drink. theres the impoerter base, but then theres a complex layered taste and mouthfeel. lots of sweetness, lots of bitterness almost keeps up. it is helped out by the wine like tannic part of the profile, which extends to a figish, almost prune like aspect from the rasin juice and very dark sugars. the spices shine a tad here and there but are not overwhelming in any way. the cardamon can be found at most times if you look. i like the progression on the palate and tongue in this one. its just a tiny bit tart, but the sweetness eventually wins over the finish, making it lightly refreshing and not too too heavy. definitely a nice offering. wouldnt mind aging a couple of these to see how they develop over a year or so.
",5
1526,"(bottle) Pours dark brown/black with a thin tan head.  Aroma has a vinous quality to it which is most similar to port, but this scent is at its strongest when the beer is still.  When swirled, plenty of the roasted malt and booze rise to the forefront.  Aroma gets considerably sweeter with warming.  Taste contains similar components as the aroma, and the wine is more present here, although tasting it yields more of a dry red wine quality, rather than the sweet port present in the aroma.  Good amount of oak.  Roasted malt is present as well with some lighter dark fruit and maybe some dark chocolate.  Finish has a lingering amount of roasted malt with some hop bitterness.  Finish is a little rough actually, as the booze, bitterness, and roast coalesce into astringency.  Mouthfeel is medium to full with a touch too much carbonation.  Overall, this is a decent beer from Lucky Bucket, and Il certainly try others from this brewery.

1529,"Thanks to Ben for bringing the bottle!  Poured medium-deep brown with an easily-resuscitated khaki head.  The aroma picked up a heavy dose of fairly generic black malts with some raisins and molasses sticking around.. very assertive, and seemingly very sweet.. seemed a lot heavier than it needed to be.  The flavor found the kick I expected, but didnt really need.. lots of sweet molasses and vanilla, with juicy raisins too.. more raisins and molasses in the end.  Medium-plus bodied and quite sweet on the palate.. a bit too hot and too raisin-y, but still tasty.. kinda brash overall.

1530,"Pours dark brownish black with off white head, thanks to BenC for the bottle.  Aroma has notes of big rum soaked raisin, brown sugar, molasses, and some slight wine and grape notes.

1536,"12 ounce bottle. Pours a murky brown/red color with a medium beige head. A sweet nose of oak, roast, sweet fruit and cocoa. The flavor is not your usual Quad thats for sure; sweet chocolates, some slight sourness, rich sweet fruity malts, oak, lots of woodiness. Nice and very warm. It rounds out to be a woody and chocolaty version of a nice quad, well made and very aggressive. Nice.

T: The roasted malt is there but mild with lots of different fruit notes. Some of the same tartness that was there on the nose, particularly the citrus and raisin components with perhaps a bit of wine.

A lot of sweet and slightly tart dark fruit and vinous flavors, but not much else, and it is slightly out of balance for me.		Notes: Wine barrels did a number on this beer. The base beer, other than the wine barrel flavors, is not wowing me either. Lots of dark fruit that is a little out of balance. Interesting beer to try, but nothing that I would search out.

1539,"Pours an opaque dark brown color, aroma of bread, not much else there.  There is a sweet cough drop taste with hints of bubble gum and mint.  The alcohol is very apparent in this one.  Medium to heavy bodied, very sticky, with average cabonation.  Finish is a sweet, almost sour taste.
",5
1540,"Pours a very dark brown with a small head and some lace. The aroma is a bit stinky up front to be honest, sort of like dank hops but slinkier. There is also some cherry and apple with some light cinnamon and light wood with aa fair bit of Christmas cookie spice. The flavor is very woody with some burnt malt bitterness. The woodiness sort of dominates and is a bit brash but as the beer warms it gives way to notes of raisin, fruit, and over steeped chamomile tea. Interesting beer to say the least.

1550,"650ml bottle from BC Liquor in West Van. Pours a straw yellow with thin white head. Aroma is potently hoppy with citrus and lemony notes along with cereal malt. Taste is similar but the extremes are more pronounced. The hops are bitingly bitter. Some citrus there, grapefruit predominantly. Malt is very cereal, bready. The two seem to work in opposition rather than in partnership. Finish is still very bitter and pointed at the end of the tongue. Its decent but not mind blowing.

Further Personal Perceptions:	-A slice of foam tops the clear blond.	-Some wooden hops are felt in the background, but they are distant.	-The packaging and flavor profile are obvious knock-offs of Sleemans products, which is not really attractive...	-I know good lagers are few and far between in Canada, but that doesnt mean Id settle for this if I badly wanted a drinkable lager.

Flavours are herbal, with mushrooms (finding those in damn near everything all of a sudden), hedges and early morning farmers fields.  Look at me trying to find new ways of describing a beer Ive essentially had four dozen times before.  What can I say, the beer is so boring I need to make my own fun.  Imagine what I can come up with when I finally have Rickards Honey Brown...tastes like watching two fat elderly people get it on...no I can do better than that...tastes like watching your dog lick his own balls...something like that anyway.

1566,"341 ml (clear) bottle from The Beer Store (part of Winter Mixer).  Pours a clear, bright golden yellow with modest-sized white head.  Aroma is certainly true to the name with a very peppery lime character - its not cloying but its not exactly delightful.  Flavour has lime, muted a bit with the pepper, and some underlying graininess.  Light body.  Not too good, but compared to the macro lime lagers (Bud Light Lime, et al) it has the distinction of not tasting like sickly sweet soda pop.

1567,"Pale gold thin white cap, looks like a normal lager to me. Wet hay with mild skunk, hints of lime but not as much as i was expecting. When warmer aroma turns sweeter and more limey but still nothing great. Aroma is underwhelmingly dull but probably the best lime beer Ive ever smelt. Taste has a fizzy pop like quality. Corn with hay no signs of the pepper, hints of lime. Lime is perfect really not over powering and not fake tasting.  light and drinkable, nice tiny bubble carbonation. High quality for what it is really, but not a beer Ill ever really completely enjoy. And why is this in the winter sampler pack and not the summer yard work pack.

Muddled black pepper mixed with very mild and faint lime up front, roughness on the roof of the mouth, unclean short finish, thin-bodied with no carry. Low complexity, low depth, low length. One-note and quite uninspiring. The pepper isnt firey or aromatic nor is the lime.

1577,"Dark brown colour with a medium-thick head.  The aroma is malt-accented but has a lot of chocolate.  On the palate, a strange combo of thin and creamy, probably from trying to shoehorn a nourishing beer into 5%abv format.  The flavours arent bad - chocolate, light roast and faint mint - and it finishes roasty.  Decent.
",5
1578,"Bomber from LDB. Rich dark brown with a red tint, and nice doily delicate tan lacing. The aroma is quite nice, really, fresh chocolate-mint in mutual balance. Almost smells like a dinner mint, childhood memories of Andes surface! but it really doesnt smell too artificial or candylike at all. The mint is actually a welcome, fresh, and fun change of pace in the aroma because it smells festive and inviting. The body is a little thin, and the chocolate malts dont quite fill the palate or linger but the flavors are pretty good. The carbonation is lively. Thats nice but a little creaminess in the palate would really lift this up. There is more chocolate malt than mint in the flavors, leaving some nice roast on the palate. The mint just livens and brightens it up. Once you get over the bias against gimmick beer, its actually not bad and much better than expected. Worth trying for sure.
",5
1579,"650ml bottle poured brown in color with about 2 fingers of off-white head which left some spotted lacing on the side of glass.  Aroma is chocolate and mint.  Taste is light malty sweetness with chocolate and mint.  This is a pretty good brew with a light to medium body and light carbonation.
",5
1580,"Bottle. Dark brown, clear, medium almond head. Aroma is unusual, to say the least. Medicinal mint is prominent, with notes of chocolate, caramel. My wife says it tastes just like a Junior Mint in a glass. I agree, with a decent balance between the fresh mintiness and sweet chocolate. Medium dry bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is on the thin side of medium-bodied. Unusual flavours that left me wondering if Id want to have another. Im still not sure.
",1
1581,"Quite deep brown - light does get through around the edges.  Huge pillowy head.  Aromas: chocolate.  Some herby/planty/grassy thing that I think must be the mint.  Tastes like after eights.  Quite strikingly actually.  The ""brown ale"" part of it disappears, pretty much.
",1
1582,"Single bottle purchased in Vernon, BC on 03/10/2011. Colour: Deep, deep, deep red with creamy low head that is a touch brownish and grey. Nose: Rubber, tar, mint, eraser, brown sugar, cooked oats. Lots going on but not great chemistry. Taste: Medium sweet, light bitter, light sour. Immediate mint hint, black tea leaves follow. Hmm...more like a light roast coffee addition instead of chocolate. Sweet corn mid-palate. Finish is a touch smokey with some char and more mint. Different and not entirely undrinkable.
",5
1583,"Draught at St. Augustines, VancouverDark brown color. Light chocolate and mint aroma. Roasted malt flavor, with light dark chocolate tones, and a more evident mint touch; dry mouthfeel; roasted malts in the finish. After Eight chocolates are better, as they are sweeter; but not a bad beer...
",1
1584,"The smell has soo much chocolate. It smells great. I want to smell it over and over. the malts are great. Not a lot of head or lacing, a bit clearish too. The chocolate is great, and theres this weird mint thing that sort of subtly happens. You could miss it if the beer were too cold or you werent quite paying attention, but it is there. that chocolate flavour lasts though. If anyone from the dead frog brewery is reading this you should flesh out the chocolate, maybe add some  cayenne pepper and forget that silly mint shit. Beer isnt a desert, its the whole damn meal!
",1
1585,"Bottle. Brown beer with a nice froth. Smells like an ""After 8"" chocolate mint as advertised. First sip is wierd. A bit metallic, a bit of smoke, chocolate and mint. I think to do this experiment properly you need to add mint to a thick chocolately porter or brown ale. This one is too tame to carry the flavours. Overall described as metallic mint with a chocolate aftertaste.
",1
1586,"Well, what the hell. The last beer disappointed so I figured that I would continue the trend. Deep red brown pour with a thumb thick light brown fizzy cap that faded out to a ring. Shitloads of strong minty chocolate as advertised. There is also some roast and a touch of herbal and some cld coffee in the background aaaaaand thats about it. The taste is likewise huge with mint chocolate, duller coffee, roast, weakest of bitterness - almost out of batteries on my phone. Tasty stuff, good frisky carbs, very good finish. I like! Go figure.
",5
1587,"Looks, a bit like root beer. malty nose with light chocolate hints. The taste is interesting. Starts like a watery ale, quickly rushing through mint, then malty chocolate then back to mint finiching with a crisp, mildly wheaty palate. Not sure if i would fight anyone for this beer, but its not a bad idea.
",1
1588,"nice minty nose with sweet chocolatey malts.  pleasant, rich, but nice mild taste.  forget After Eight dinner mints, this is the perfect dessert beverage.  well, maybe not quite perfect.  was hoping for a little more chocolate in the finish.

1589,"Dark, rich garnet brown with a thin head, light menthol aroma, thin and fizzy with a bit of chocolate, faint coffee maltiness and mint. About as much hop as a dead frog, disappointing dry finish... its not easy being green!
",1
1590,"Dark brown with a very thick head. Very minty aroma. Interesting flavour. you can taste the mint and the chocolate. but it does not meld well with the rest of the beer. it clashed very hard with the natural malt flavour. A very interesting Idea but poorly executed . The flavour is bitter and un appealing.  Flavour. like burnt asperagus.

1591,"Dark brown,fast fading tan head.Light chocolate mint nose. Thin watery malt profile. Minty, with a faint hop finish
",1
1592,"Pours a lively head that is very fizzy and bubbles away to nothing in less than 2 mins.  Lots of chocolate in the nose, little mint.  Taste is almost porter like, more chocolate, and finishes with a minty aftertaste.  Quite good.
",5
1593,"Bottle. Pours clear brown, thin off-white head, spotty lacing. Nose is cocoa nibs, HUGE mint, coffee, little else. Smells like choco-mint ice cream. Flavours are more coffee and mint, subdued chocolate; medium to light bodied. Noticeable yeast notes. Short minty finish. Different but alright.
",1
1594,"It pours a brown color with a 1 finger head that vanishes to a thin ring.		On the nose I am getting mostly mint followed by some chocolate notes.		The flavor has a good amount of chocolate up front and some roasted notes. As well a little mint present. The big down fall is that it is a little too thin.		It finishes with strong lingering mint and some faint hop bitterness. I can say that I am not a fan of mint but I am a brown lover. This is a actually not too bad. I could see it being more of a christmas time beer.

1595,"Pours a dark dark brown colour with a thin white head. The aroma is stong mint and light malts. The taste is very light chocolate with a strong mint aftertaste and light on the palate.
",1
1596,"341 ml bottle from The Beer Store (part of Winter Mixer). Pours a clear dark orange with small white head.  Aroma is definitely mandarin orange slightly sweet, but with a little peel-like sourness as well as some cereal grains.  Taste is semi-sweet mandarin orange-like flavour not so sweet as to be classic soda pop-ish (the Orangina comment is bang on) with some grainy malt.  Fine, but strong carbonation.  Not great, but probably my favourite of the mixer in that it was at least a little different.  I have to say though if the Winter Mixer has a mandarin orange beer, a lime beer and a pale lager, what does the Summer Mixer have?
",1
1597,"pours amber orange (no surprise), micro CO2 with ringed retention, thin sticky lacing. A bit of malt on the nose. Aromas of mandarin orange and orange peel up front mixed with cutting-sharp chilled CO2 bubbles (stings the palate), and then finishes medium malty bitter - long and lingering bitterness. Viscosity is thinnish, low-medium complexity, low-medium length, low depth, and low carry. This beer is refreshing but it dies out fast in the mid and finish. I only enjoy the mandarin orange aroma, but one bottle is enough.
",1
1598,"Mandarin orange amber ale???? ok???? Beer appears to be amber brown as it sits in the unfortunate clear bottle. Aroma is interesting and surprisingly good. Aroma is of mandarin oranges but its the canned version not fresh, toast, hints of sour. Carbonation is a bit sharp and stingy. Beer taste very unique and Im digging this. Cereal type malts, and a very obvious but not over bearing canned mandarin flavor. Just got the flavour it almost a perfect mach to that Italian pop ""Orangina"" mixed with some beer. I can drink this brew but Id probably get sick of it after a couple and would only want to have once or twice a year but this still  a good brew.
",1
1599,"Bottle. Clear, medium amber, short-lived white cap, no lace. Aroma is dominated by tangerine skin with underlying cereal. Flavour is bitter orange peel and weak caramel malt. Finish is brief, bitterness is low.
",1
1600,"UPDATED: DEC 27, 2010 ""Mandarin Orange Amber Ale is a succulent, robust, welcoming amber ale so refreshing its like running naked through the snow!""	Yah, right! I dont think so! Unfortunately the moderate malty character overpowers the orange fruit flavour... too bad.

1601,"341 ml bottle from The Beer Store (part of Winter Mixer).  Pours a clear dark amber colour with small light tan head.  Aroma is nutty, with a hint of mild choclate. Flavour is similar though slightly sour.  A touch watery.  Ok.

1602,"Pours a rich clear brown colour, with a small off-white head. Aroma is of grain malts, slight caramel and lots nut scents. Taste is a little dry with a slight sweetness throughout, fairly malty. Medium body, softer carbonation, smooth on the palate. Overall a serviceable brown ale.
",1
1603,"Draught at Beachside Restaurant on Marina Dr., West VancouverBrown color. Light nutty aroma (and also detergent, but this is the fault of the pipes at Beachside restaurant on Marina Drive). Weak body, light caramel and nutty flavor, dry. Correct bitterness. Simple, but its balanced, and pleasant.
",1
1604,"Bottle. Dark pour. filmy white head. light lacing. Bland aromas of caramel, toasted malts, some faint chocolate and sweet almond. Taste is similar. Faint toasted notes, some caramel and not much else. Slightly bitter finish. Not bad. not great. I probably wouldnt buy again but I would try it off tap.

1605,"Bottle. Dark amber, clear, decent tan head. Little aroma of caramel, nuts, toast. Light body, soft carbonation. Taste of toffee, nuts, a little hops.	An ok nut brown, nothing more.

1606,"Has an okay fake hazelnut and malt smell. Decent brown colour and an okay head. flavour is a nice refreshing nut taste, with a medium finish. Its reliable and tasty, though simple.
",1
1607,"Bottle. Clear deep amber brown, light golden head. Aroma is nice toasty caramel, light chocolate. Same flavours on the palate: dark toffee with cocoa accents, sweet, but a light bitterness dries it out a bit. The best of the Dead Frog offerings Ive tried so far, but that doesnt say much.
",1
1608,"Sampled at village taphouse in West Vancouver. Standard nut brown colour with thin cream head. Aroma is very subdued (served too cold) but still I had a hard time picking out much but a small whiff of malt. Taste is more interesting. Light slightly woody tasting malt, a little thin and astringent. Flavour dies away rapidly with little if any hops. Okay, weak in style.
",1
1609,"Sampled at Viti, pours light brown. Aroma and flavour of light toasted nuts and roasted malt. Drinkable.
",1
1610,"Ahhh... afternoon beer!	Poured out a small light tan head that has pretty good retention and some random lacing, nice brown body. Well, I really had to let this warm for the aroma to seep out. Roasted malts, dusty chocolate, weak (thankfully) but coffee that is noticeable in the background. Comes across somewhat flavourless and Ive noticed that quality before in Browns. Roasted malts, some berry sweetness, mild hops. Then, sometimes I get a bunch of flavour if I look. Finishes nice with drying cardboard bitterness. Needs work.
",1
1611,"Dark brown body with a noisy 1 cap and the custom made bottle with the road killed frog cast into the side is a nice touch. Nutty chocolaty aroma with some sour soap and just a touch of fine ground coffee. Very rich malty taste with roasted elements more light chocolate and coffee with a mild dry bitter finish. Noticing a mild hop bite. This is a good beer I was pleasantly surprised.

1612,"Nose of sugar, lots of roasted malt and some peruvian coffee beans. A light brown/orange colour was displayed...and fine head. Much too carbonated....my bottle popped like a soda can when opened and I swear I picked up a hint of coca-cola in the mouth. Chocolate and too much sugar accompanied this. Decent finish...

1613,"341ml clear bottle. Dark/chocolate brown in colour, orange highlights. Creamy beige head, good lacing. Nutty, dusty dryish aroma with hint of roast.

1614,"dark brown with little head, an aroma with a trace of nuttiness and oats to it, but could have been stronger. Decent nutty bite on the taste.
",1
1615,"Nice nutty taste. With the gimicky name of the brewery I didnt have high expectations. Quite a nice beer though. I could taste hops, and a smooth creamy nutty flavor. It poured out with a nice head but that quickly disappeared. That was a little disappointing.I would buy it again though.

1616,"Deep brown hue, small but thick head, leaves ample and attractive lacing. Mild nutty aromas and flavors, very smooth palate. Must have been served up fresh at the Central bar, because I had 3 of these and none yielded any sourness.

1620,"(Draught) Sampled at The Beagle in Victoria for $5.65 a pint. Pours a thin, tan head with a deep chestnut coloured body. Nose is mildly nutty as is the flavour. The malt is very thin and, though it has a nice texture, its a pretty flavourless beer.
",1
1621,"Less than overpowering aroma of sweet malt and brown sugar. Poured a dark brown with a tiny head and some lace. Very sweet, slightly toasty and only the faintest hopping. Poor carbonation but a good body. Drinkable, but only if nothing else is available.

1636,"650ml bottle pours a golden color with some orange highlights.  There is about a finger of white head which leaves a few spots of lace.  Aroma is light citrus.  Taste is light malty sweetness with a moderate citrusy hop bitterness in the finish.  A decent enough IPA which was quite enjoyable.
",5
1637,"Outstanding. Citra is what it claims to be - but not to the exclusion of what we want in an IPA. The citrus is mild and compliments the hops perfectly. Bitterness is not overwhelming - not sure of the IBU rating but I would put it at 60-70. Delightfully bold but smooth.
",5
1638,"Thanks to boney for this.  Great looking dark orange gold with a frothy white top.  Aroma is citrus hops and a great sweet honey malt.  Taste is a slow build of citrus hop bitterness and a great malt backbone that is just phenomenal.  Great beer, wish it was around me.

1641,"This pours a golden color with a 1 finger white head that falls to a lingering cap, it has some small spots of lacing.		On the nose, I am getting a little hints of citrus and some faint pine, I can say not what I was expecting.		In the flavor, I get some carmel notes up front and some real maltiness. This is all washed away by some citrus notes(lemon and grapefruit) and a ton of spicy hop notes. It does have a little warmth from the alcohol but It does seem to be a little one sided.		It finishes with just a huge lingering bitterness and a hint of lemon zest. It is a little unbalanced but still worth a shot.

1642,"I did this beer back to back with Big Rocks IPA... WOW night and day. This is what I look for in an IPA. Great orange gold coloring with minimal head. Huge hop aroma with grapefruit, citrus, and mango. Very well balanced overall from the aroma, to the body, to the end. The hop is very consistent all the way through. Ends perfect.
",5
1643,"Label describes it as ""high hopped, high bitterness, true IPA ... like an open handed slap ..."" It is a bit bold, but not overly bold. I actually found it quite pleasant. Malty-sweet nose. Tasty malt flavors of cocoa powder, light toffee and bread. Hops are citrusy and bright, though not as lemony as most citra IPAs Ive had. Regardless, its hop flavors and aromas are very nice. Healthy bitterness to boot. Solid beer.
",5
1644,"This one caught me off guard as I had heard mostly bad things about Dead Frog. The pour is a bright amber orange with a two finger thick white head. The aroma is tons of citrus hops with a light herbal pine note. A predominantly bitter grapefruit taste with a mild caramel maltiness and light alcohol finish. What sets this apart is a nice tropical fruit flavour. Pineapple, peach, and mango are all subtly present in the middle. A big hop bomb finish, but overall this is a nice citra IPA!
",5
1645,"I was very surprised at the flavor of this beer - great on the nose. I was expecting more of a lemon on the palate but it was smooth and not as harsh as I thought it would be.
",5
1646,"Poured out a light clear amber with a big light tan bubbly cap that takes a couple of minutes to die down. Wow! This has incredible aroma - huge and sweet citruses that is very sharp and almost sour, massive peach, rrgf, apricot and candy - the usual suspects but the intensity and the lemony citrus is quite an eye opener. Hella sweet and potent, oranges everywhere and somewhere buried beneath is a bit of caramel. The blend of citrus things here is different than Ive smelt before. I taste things... things like huge citrus and brutal bitterness that strike within milliseconds of the first sip. Orange, tons of rrgf, lemon, more bitterness, peaches, caramel and a very long bitter finish. Sweetness and candy. Nothing new here but holy shit is this bitter. The aroma wins in this one. Decent carbonation. I dig this beer but got bored - this would have been more enjoyable if it was only a small bottle.

1647,"Bottle, shared with me by Parksy after I helped him move 3 bookcases, one eliptical trainer (fuuucck), and one re-upholstered-but-still-ugly chair down the street to Dodos and Daves. ... and it was totally WORTH IT!!! Light bright orange amber, thick lasting head that generates fine early lace. Aroma is beautiful hoppy citrus and tropical fruit. Just a fresh full-on hop blast. Juicy hoppy palate, with lots of fresh citrus, some passionfruit, and resinous pine that becomes more apparent in the long bitter finish. In a blind taste test I would never in a million years would have guessed this to come from Dead Frog-- super well-done, and their best offering by a long shot. Really excellent.

1648,"Single bottle purchased from Zyn Liqour in Calgary, AB on 04/15/2011. Light brown with light medium head. Nose: Hop dominant but accompanied by freshly squeezed citrus juices (mainly lime and orange) and some forest moss. Well presented. Taste: Medium-light sweet, medium-high bitter, light sour. Christams pudding, at first then straight into blasting hops that just get stronger and stronger right through the finish - which lasts forever. Biting and lively - a touch more citrus in the palate would have been nice.

1663,"Pours a medium gold with decent white foam that lasts for quite a while. Thin ring persists to the end. Aroma is certainly citrus hops with a slight note of dried leaves. Flavour is full on hops. Citrus followed by a slight pot funk. Some caramel malt in there as well but this is far from balanced. Despite being a full frontal hop assault the beer is not bad. Having said that it would be nice for it to have a little more dimension.

Quite a nice brew.

1671,"Cloudy brown.  Rich head.  Light caramel aroma with graham crackers.  Light palate, but the oak exerts a definite influence.  Nicely balanced - the oak livens up this normally staid brew, lends a hint of tartness in the finish and that cuts through the sweetness while leaving behind all the nutty brown ale character.

1675,"On tap. Clear & coppery with a big lasting head. Ok carbonation. This beer has a nice hop aroma. However, the hop flavor is muted in comparison. Malt has a very mild sweetness and gives this beer a body that is on the light side of medium. Dead Frog has created a beer that will offend nobody, but lacks boldness. Craft beer for the mainstream.

1676,"Copper brown, with large rocky cap, massive bubble creators are forming everywhere in it. Mild soapy aroma some coffee and a touch of sweaty feet, yum yum doesnt that sound appetizing. Taste is watery with weak malts, hops or noticeable with a very mild bitterness. I got to remind myself this an EPA, not an APA. Some peach and mild coffee and chocolate also show up. Very boring beer with not nearly enough malt character, bellow average and easily forgettable.

1677,"Bottle: Poured an amber color ale with a large foamy head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of dry caramel malt with light dry hops as well. Taste is dominated by not overly complex dry caramel malt with very little hops apparent. Body is about average with good carbonation. Standard pale ale with little character but no flaws as well.

1690,"UPDATED: APR 16, 2005 Bright brick amber colour; finger of dense foam denotes either a richly hopped beer or a frothier gas mixture.  Probably the latter given the faintness of the nose - a little bit of herbal hop but little else.  The palate is crisp, with some wood-oven notes and earthy, caramelly undertones.  The finish is accented towards the foresty (American-style) end of the spectrum, but the hops are restrained and balanced by slight earthiness of yeast and malt, in the English style.

1692,"Amber and bright.  The aroma is gingers and mildly spicy. Thin, messy with bland amber and a bunch of incoherent spices.  Boring.

1693,"This tastes exactly like it would taste if an ale had cinnamon and some other spices thrown into it. There is just no jiving together of this stuff, its way out of balance. Certainly a poor attempt at a Christmas ale, but then again, we did manage to finish the bottle!
",1
1694,"Bomber. Dark amber, moderate head. Aroma is certainly bland, of stale cardboard malts and supermarket gingerbread. The spices are not expressed well, and are barely there at all. A thin stream of generic cakey malts and light, low-grade brown sugar are the only things I taste here. Dreadfully boring.
",1
1695,"Thanks DougTicket for the bottle. Poured a dark amber with minimal white head. The aroma was very weak to me and I had a hard time picking out much. There was a touch of gingery spice. The taste was full of spices with a solid malt base. I get a good dose of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. I found the spice a little overpowering by the end of the bottle. Mouthfeel was smooth and quite highly carbonated. Decent christmas beer but too heavy on the spices for my regular enjoyment.
",1
1696,"OK Xmas beer. Sweet, possibly too sweet. Spicy, but not overspiced. Malts are toasty, with sugary notes of honey, nuts and caramel. Hops are subdued, with very subtle hints of grass and flowers. Cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg are noticeable, but theyre not necessarily excessive, as mentioned. Alcohol level is low, especially for your typical Xmas beer. Overall, its a pleasant and relatively easy-to-drink beer suited for the holidays.

1704,"Bottle, shared with my father in law. Light amber, ecru head, short lived. Spicy aroma, with nutmeg standing out. Heavy on the spice, which is fine by me, but light on the malt, which is NOT fine by me. Not offensive, just a little thin and one dimensional.

1705,"Nice use of spices in the aroma - it suggests gingerbread without overwhelming. Clear deep copper coloured body is topped by a decent white fine bubbled head that recedes to a lasting cover.  Quite sweet with obvious gingerbread flavours. Light offsetting bitterness. Medium full body is somewhat slick in texture with pleasantly pointy effervescence.  Really quite a nice suggestion of gingerbread without bludgeoning the tastebuds with the spices. Tulip glass. Cellar temperature. Bottle received as an ex-moose gift!  Thank you yellow pepper!

1707,"Bottle purchased 01/05/2011. Colour is dark brown and clear. Nose: a basket of spices, including ginger, sage, rosemary and oregano. Also mixed in is a touch of peat, toffee sauce, and traces of rubber. Taste: mild sweet, medium bitter, mild sour. Spices transfer over to the palate which is great, but so does the off-rubber note. Too bad.

1708,"(650ml bottle) Purchased at Spinnakers Wine Merchants in Vic West. Standard orange body with a creamy, beige head. Nose is all Cinnamon and nutmeg. Cloying and overly gingerbread. Whatever happened to a ""winter warmer"" being 7% ABV and containing some complexity? This is a 5% ABV introduction to girlie beers to be had during the non-Raspberry ale spritzer months. Pretty disappointing.

1711,"HELLO GINGERBREAD!!!! This is like sticking your nose into a gingerbread house to do a smell inspection. A bit sweet from malt, but mostly its moist and gingerbready. Mine filled the boot with a nice head but it dies down too quicklly, not too bad.... actually pretty darn good lacing though. The flavour is more like a beer than liquid gingerbread house, thankfully, there is just some wam notes of the ginger after the usual malts, yeast and then some faint x-mas beer spices. The taste is actually a bit flat and dill after that immense bouquet. The foam is nice and creamy, just a bit of lingering ginerbread on the mouth, nothing too strong here. I like it. Its a christmas beer that smells fantastic and then doesnt beat up your mouth with over-the-top you should only drink this once a year richness like eggnog and other christmas and oktoberfsts. Or maybe everything just tastes better out of a boot...

Smells more like wit than coconut with lots of sweet yeast and vanilla cake, is very refreshing on the tongue. Light and lively. The finish is very nice and toasty although I dont get coconut. Pretty dry but finishes a little sweet and sticky. Its thin but really not that bad and I appreciate the restraint on the coconut, in fact, its got none to speak of, which means that it doesnt have the artificial flavoring or aromas I was expecting. I think its pretty nice even if not the mosti sophisticated beer on the world.

1736,"Bottle, shared by davey. Bright hazy yellow, dense white cap, no lace. Aroma is interesting: assertively wheaty, estery, but with a mixture of lemony citrus and earthy coconut nuances. Quite appealing really. Flavours of tart lemony wheat with subtle background coconut. Not toasty really, more like young green coconut, and not in-your-face. The coconut is subtle but definitely part of the palate. I was quite happy with this one; the BeerMaster series from these guys is fun and interesting.

",1
1754,"UPDATED: JAN 7, 2008 Terrible beer, with a very strong phenolic character, not due to cloves, but due to off-flavors from wild yeast, which the brewer tried to mask by putting a heavy coating of cinnamon and sugar on the rim of the glass. The phenols come through in both the aroma and the flavor, which was also the case in other AP beers. The beer was cloudy, with a sporadic head. Cloudiness bears out the infection. Two of us split ~a 10 oz pour, and we could not finish it. On top of that, we were charged $12 for this minuscule pour. The claim is that this price is due to the high alcohol level, which is EXTREMELY unlikely. Based on palate considerations, it is likely less than 10%, this is just a poorly made beer that the brewer is making excuses for.

1755,"On tap at Alt Platz.  6 oz glass, part of the edge dipped in powdered sugar and spices.  Murky chestnut brown with a beige ring of froth.  First waft is gingerbread, thence on a wonderful amalgam of Christmas and pumpkin spice luring but not revealing the complete picture.  Rich and smooth, mild carb.  Wonderful to sip and savor.  Cinnamon, ginger, cardamon, clove, mace and nutmeg are prominent.  Hints of chipotle?  A deft spice balance reminiscent of Pannepot.  But this is a pumpkin beer and rightly so.  Dont think pie think baked pumpkin, earthy and fleshy, and thats what really makes this beer shine.  An American classic.

1757,"UPDATED: MAY 21, 2007 I recalled this being listed as 18% ABV and now I see someone has changed it to 7.5% ABV. (NOTE: I now see where and why it was changed. Im not sure why it lists the 7.5 % ABV on the website and why he told us that it was 16.5% in person unless there are two versions. Ill try to confirm.  UPDATE Got an email response from Tom. This batch was aged 8 months and came out to 16.5%. However, the next batch may not be. He will start brewing in 6 weeks and in 4-5 months, it will be ready and probably a different ABV. We can change it then). This was on at the Virginia Beer Festival yesterday (5-19-07) and the brewer, Tom, confirmed that this was actually 16.5% ABV in front myself, maniac and Cameron from Coastal Wine Connection. So I will be changing it after this review. Came out a thick muddy orange-rust color. Nose was powerful. Lots of spices, pumpkin pie, soft liquor and sweet malts. Maybe candied yams with marshmellows on them as well. Taste is bigger spice but its not overdone. Some soft alcohol, candy, sticky sugars and pumpkin pie. Body is medium-full to full. Soft carbonation. Very sticky but no warmth I could detect. Ends with more spices and pumkin pie with sticky sweet candyish notes. This went very quick once it was known to be out and the lines were large. Very well done pumpkin beer!

1758,"On tap at Alt Platz served in 6oz glasses. Dark dark amber in color with a thick beige head.

This was by far the best pumpkin beer Ive had.

1759,"On tap at the brewpub 6 oz glass. Dark brown color off white head. Very complex aroma and taste. No alcohol taste this one will sneak up on you. The best pumpkin ale, I have had.
",5
1760,"Right place, right time. Scammed some of Immys pre-release treat. After all of the seasonal & pumpkin ales I have tasted and frowned upon I wasnt expecting to flip over one anytime soon, but this one was an eye opener, an awakening of slumbering senses. I think the brewer has his mother chained in the back making homemade pumpkin pie to mix in this brew. The golden-pumpkin-orange colored brew looked like pumpkin pie topped with a creamy off-white head like it was cool-whip. Aroma is every fresh spice you would expect in grandmas pie on Turkey day and then some. Flavor was same, spice combination perfectly complimented the pumpkin flavor in this soul warming spiced brew. Watch out for the alcohol because the high level is very well hidden making it easy to drink and yearning for more. Too bad for the rest of the world but due to the limited quantities only us few lucky locals will be priviledged enough to enjoy this outstanding brew. I know what I am doing for Halloween!

1761,"On tap at the brewpub. The owner gave me a sneak peek sample of this beer, to be officially released October 31. Golden brown with a big, thick, creamy beige head. Very complex nose - lots of spices, including (but not limited to) ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a light clove. Lots more, hard to nail them all down. An underlying pumpkin is behind the lush spiciness. Excellent, warming pumpkin pie flavors! Warming spiced finish, alcohol is present but VERY well disguised. Like a fortified wine, the nose blooms from the empty glass. Absolutely wonderful, the best Ive ever had of the style. Im no fan of pumpkin beers, but this is amazing. VERY well done, and thanks for the preview Tom!

1774,"Virginia Beer Fest 2007. Dark brown body with a creamy tan head. Sweet roasted malt aroma with some fruity hints. Rum soaked fruit and chocolate flavor with some caramel and molassas in the background.
",1
1775,"On tap at Alt Platz. Color was a dark brown with some reddish tints and a tan head that leaves a nice lacing. Aroma was a nutty chocolate and malt. Flavor gives you the same nutty chocolate and a nice bitter chocolate finish.
",5
1776,"Draft at the brewpub, 10/28/06: Only 1 of the 3 beers I tried that I actually liked.  Not sure what the brewer would classify it as, so I entered as ""ale"" ... sorry!  Almost has the character of a Scotch Ale.  Dark black with a tan standing head.  Syrupy and thick with a definite molasses, strong malt tone.  Strong and good ... the one fine point of our visit.
",5
1777,"Machtig Brau Strong Ale. Dark brown brew foamy tan head. Nutty chocolate aroma. Flavor is bitter chocolate and sweet malt, very smooth, medium body with a bit of an oily feel and a nice warmth from the alcohol but without the alcohol taste. Very drinkable. I had 2 pints and took home a growler. Great brew!
",5
1778,"2 Liter Growler Bought onsite-Beautiful pour- excellent head retention- nice creamy white ring that stayed through entire mug	Hints of Chocolate and coffee- This one is dangerous- first by relaxing you with flavor, then a punch to the skull with alcohol! Awesome beer none the less.This guy is for real- rumors are the Platz is no good- rumors are full of shit-	Highly recommended if you want real beer!  Plus the prices are very reasonable for the product.

1779,"From growler, courtesy of Immy.  Poured a very deep brown with hints of red.  Foamy tan head.  Nose has a mild nuttiness to it.  Flavor is sweet malts with a touch of sour.  Bitter baking chocolate in the aftertaste.  Palate is creamy.  Alcohol is nowhere to be seen, until youre done that is, which doesnt take long due to the immense drinkability of this one.
",5
1780,"1L growler from the brewpub, of course. Deep brown with a thick, creamy beige head. Excellent thick lace. Nutty aromas, some chocolate. Nice, smooth chocolate nut flavors (walnut?) with an even sweet maltiness. Bitter chocolate finish. Nice round body. Very nice - well done!
",5
1781,"On tap at Alt Platz. Golden in color with an off-white head. Aroma was bready with a touch of hops lurking around. Flavor was a combination of yeast and sweet malt.
",1
1782,"Once again the Platz delivers! Had an hour to kill so I stopped by- Glad I did. This is a definate off the beaten path brew. A helles(german for clear) Not many styles like this one but rest assured it is grand! Pours a nice creamy white head with excellent release of aroma, fruity citrus notes- perfect carbonation, just enough to release the aroma- not soapy- first a slight hop bite then an overature of malty sweetness.	With a finish that is to be reckoned wth.	These go down oh so easliy- perfect compliment to the pretzels ordered with the brew, a salty sweet affair. Not had one helluva helles like this since Austria many years back. A perfect rendition of  the Bavarian style. A must have again!!!!	The Alt Platz , Das Gte Platz!!!!!!!
",5
1783,"UPDATED: NOV 5, 2006 Draft at the brewpub, 10/28/06: Helles?  This is orange-copper, the darkest helles Ive ever seen.  (Hey, call the beer whatever you want, but check a style guide.  Auf Deutsch, Helles=Light, Dunkel=Dark).  Again, zero head, zero carbonation.  Almost like a sour orange soda.  Unimpressed.
",1
1784,"On tap with Immy at brewpub. Dark gold, golden ale, foamy white head. Fruity aroma of apple and pear with slight notes of bread. Flavor much the same, sweet malty fresh fruit, medium to heavy body. Very easy drinking.
",5
1785,"On tap at the brewpub. Clear deep gold with an off white head. Nose is bready with a light hoppiness. Bready, biscuity flavor, sweet malt. Even malty finish. Nice.
",1
1786,"Draft: Curious raisin and yeast aroma. Greenish dark copper color with a medium head. It has a nice initial tangy punch that gives way to a pleasant moderate hoppiness. I have found that the quality of hops this brewer uses is top knotch. Its a tad tinny, but finishes cleanly.
",1
1787,"On tap at Alt Platz. Color was a dark brown with a small tan head. Aroma was malty with floral hops and a bit nutty. Flavor was a nutty chocolate with a nice hop bitterness in the finish.  Keep up the good work Tom.
",5
1788,"On tap at the brewpub. Dark brown color with no head.  Aroma and taste of coffee and chocolate, really dark for a amber ale.
",5
1789,"Draft at the brewpub, 10/28/06: Looks like a flat coke ... and kinda tastes like one too.  Dirty sock aroma.  Bit of a sour tone, like sweet malt soda.  No thanks.
",1
1790,"On tap at the brewpub. Deep clear brown with a small tan head. Nutty chocolate nose, herbal hops. Mild chocolate and nut flavors, hops come to the fore in the finish, a herbal bitterness. Very nice!
",5
1791,"Sedona Bronze Ale. Clear, dark brown/bronze. Minimal head. Nutty aroma maybe a bit of raisin, sweet to taste, a bit smoked flavor and a light sweet chocolate aftertaste. Good stuff.
",5
1792,"Tall(24oz)- purchased onsite. Was not on tap yet, but the bartender pulled me one from the cooler( Very Nice Gesture) They call it a Brozne- a hybrid brew based on the dark almost reddish brown(bronze) appearance-Excellent aroma- nicely hopped-immediate bite on the palate then a smooth rush of maltiness with a touch of sweetness- one thing I will say about this brewey is their ability to balance the beers with hop/malt tones without over powering- the beer is very pleasant and different - Unique would be the term. Once again I left happy with that all natural buzz from a great brew. Also had a pizza- and it was phenominal!!!! Dough for the pies is made onsite also- a 24oz superior beer and a great pie for less than a movie- this place floundering- I beg to differ!!!!	The impertinence this brewery is getting is a disgrace- and those that are spreading it should be throttled about the head and neck reagion! Well done Alt Platz!!! Keep up the good beers!!!!!
",5
1793,"UPDATED: JAN 7, 2008 First off, this is NOT a Marzen. Way too dark, and WAY to strong a roast character for the style. Strongly phenolic in aroma and flavor, which greatly overpowers any positive malt or hop character. Phenolic character most likely is from wild yeast infection, although in another beer the brewer claims it is from cloves. Why would anyone put cloves in a marzen? Pours clear, with a nice off-white head. I strongly doubt the claims of alcohol level. It is very likely 6-8 % at most.
",1
1794,"On tap at Alt Platz.  Murky brown with a brief white head.  An excellent Mrzen.  Nose is woody caramel and smoky apple.  Taste is caramel and nuts with a bit of butterscotch.  Light sourness plays nicely off sweet notes.  Medium body with just enough carb.  Clean finish with light pith.  Fresh and flavorful, top-notch.
",5
1795,"First let me say that I didnt care for the beer being served in a chilled glass but I let that slide. The owner Tom is really cool and told me a bit about his love of beer. I was kind of shocked to find that he is so anti ratebeer.com oh well, the guy could do well if he just accepted the fact that anything served to the public will be critized and talked about. Anyway this poured from the tap like you typical IPA orange look to it with a light orange head. Aroma is unfortunatley killed because of serving the beer in a chilled glass but I can pick up a light sweetness and hops. Let the beer warm for a good 15 minutes on purpose. Finally upon sip the beer was very sweet I thought for an IPA. Not bad at all just very sweet. The malts obviously went crazy in this brew and the hops seem to just barley balance it all out. However I will say that despite its sweetness it was very drinkable and actually damn good. All I could get out of the brewer is that he uses nothing but German hops which are less powerful than say Cascade or Chinook, ect. so that is why the beer is sweeter.
",5
1796,"I dont like IPAs, but I know what it supposed to be, and this is a good IPA.  A slight dyactel or oily flavor, but it wasnt too bad.  If you like IPA, you will like this beer.
",5
1797,"Lots of banana and some good clean malt notes.  Well above average.
",5
1798,"Cloudy ruby. Faint berry nose and taste, nearly vinegary. Good lace
",1
1799,"Draught at Sailor HagarsThe aroma is light, it reminds me some cider. Dry mouthfeel, malt and caramel flavor, maybe with a light trace of honey at the end; strong bitterness. Simple.

1800,"Pint on tap at Sailor Hagars in North Vancouver.		Beer is brewed by Howe Sound Brewing and is Howe Sound Pilsner Plunge under a sudonym.		Appearance: Orangey gold and slightly opaque, with a vibrant bubbly white head that quickly recedes to a gentle ring, but leaves lots of lacing.		Aroma: Not overpowering, but inviting. Subtle honey, and the kind of crisp hop aroma you can only get from a good quality pilsner.		Taste: Crisp and refreshing, with subtle honey and a big hop flavour. Lots of bitterness and some tart citrus flavours from the hops. This beer shows how both a honey lager and a pilsner should be made, unlike many others in the Pacific northwest. Pilsners in the PNW tend to be a little sweet for the style, but this beer from Howe Sound only has subtle sweetness from the honey, with no other unfortunate sweetness. It is very tempered with the hops, so the overall flavour is bitter, not sweet, with the honey adding complexity and flavour rather than rich sweetness. The finish is very long and bitter, only slightly dry, with hints of honey and subtle grassiness from the Saaz hops, and is intensely rewarding. One of the nicest pilsners anywhere in the world.		Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and faintly silky from the honey.		Drinkability: Very moreish. Simply not possible to only have one of these exceptional pilsners.
",5
1801,"(Draught) Pours a medium, foamy white head with a amber body. Nose of mild English malts and a touch of honey sweetner. The flavour lines-up similarly with the additional Czech Pils hoppiness and bitter finish. Somewhat average at best.
",1
1802,"I dont know if theyve changed the recipe since I last had this, but it seems to be improved.  Pale golden, creamy white head.  Pale malt aroma with some light honey underneath but also a fairly assertive Saaz aroma.  Spicy flavour with a touch of breadiness.  Lingering bitterness.  Quite a surprise, actually.
",1
1803,"This was always the crapper of the Hagars lineup, but its gone straight up macro since Howe Sound took over.  Light straw colour.  Grainy aroma with doughy yeast note and ultra bland hops.  I doubt theyre using teutonic nor slavic varieties anymore.  Probably more like Willamette or something equally flavorless, and in miniscule quantities.
",1
1804,"Golden colour with a small head.  Aroma is light honey and malts.  Some hop flavour but mostly thin and sweet.
",1
1805,"Light golden in color with a light sweet honey aroma. Mostly hop flavour with a bit of honey, poor aftertaste.
",1
1806,"Sweet cloying flavour with a stale bitter finish.  eh....
",1
1807,"I detected a sweet note in the aroma, which possibly was honey but it wasnt noticeable in the flavor.I found this easy drinking, but slightly bland
",1
1808,"Very cream with some light burnt notes.
",1
1809,"Hand-pump at Sailor HagarsHazy dark amber color; creamy head. The aroma is light, but there is a good caramel flavor, quite sweet, with respectable bitterness. Not fully British, but quite good.
",1
1810,"A shame this isnt made on-premises any more. Along with the IPA, this was one of Sailor Hagars best offerings and one of the best in BC.
",5
1811,"Thick, chewy caramel, butterscotch and toffee with floral hop notes in the aroma.  Clear, deep, copper coloured body is topped by a thin, dense, cream coloured head that coats the glass.  Caramel malt sweetness is balanced nicely by assertive bitterness.  Earthy, floral hop notes offer counterpoint.  Medium body with low carbonation that feels right for the style.  Sampled on tap with Oakes and CapFlu at Sailor Hagars in North Van in May 2007.
",1
1812,"(650ml bottle) Purchased at the Sailor Hagars Off-Sale for ~$5. Quite a compliment when your former employer keeps a beer named after you - Gary Lohin must be honoured... and its a solid beer based on his recipe. Lasting almond-coloured, foam head with a deep copper body. Nose is strong and balanced of malt and hops. A robust fruitiness and well malted flavour - though its so hoppy that it would be a logical replacement for a thirsty hophead!
",1
1813,"Bottle. Hazy orange amber, lowish head. Fruity strawberry, honeyish  and earthy minerally notes. Mellow, welllagererd mouthfeel. Bitter dry finish. Earthy hop  aftertaste.
",5
1814,"UPDATED: NOV 23, 2004 Copper coloured with a nice thick off-white head.  Spicy and citrusy hop character, caramel malt, and soft carbonation.  Nice.  A bit hoppier than the Narwhal Pale Ale, but with many of the same characteristics.  Dry-hopping is noticable and well-appreciated.
",5
1815,"Funny how this is retired and I drank it last week. For admin's info it is now contract brewed by Howe Sound.	pours a very dark amber color, creamy off white head.  A huge citrusy nose erupts from the nose with hints of sweet apples and caramel.  The body has great depth, juicy hops, apples,  cinnamon, hints of caramel is run over the tongue very smoothly. Orangish bitter off dry finish.  Superb!
",5
1816,"Orange body with a chunky floating head.  Aroma is fruity and very spicy.  A very unique nose.  Flavour was very hoppy and the finish was long, sweet and a little harsh for my liking.
",1
1817,"Deep amber-red colour.  Buttery malt aroma and initial flavour to match.  Then some bitter hops leading to a dry finish.
",5
1818,"UPDATED: JAN 18, 2003 Opaque red brown, thick lasting off white head.Faint nose. Bitter..no noticeable malt. Long strong finish. Poorly balanced	Re Rate Jan 18 /03	Great carmel malt nose.Carmelized malt palate with medium lingering hop finish
",5
1819,"Orange color, clouded by many-a chunk of floating yeast.  Nose is juicy and fruity with citrus notes and some spice.  Roasted hop flavors are prevalent in the body with a little malt poking through.  Finishes long and with a touch of sweetness, although not much.  An ok ESB, but the hop flavors arent for me.
",1
1820,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2005 Bright amber colour.  Light bitterness, a fair dose of crystal malt chewiness, and light mango/papaya esters.  Slightly sticky finish.  As with the Narwhal, it is a subtlely complex ale with a distinct Howe Sound imprint.  Good on them for using a fun yeast, too.
",5
1821,"Dark red appearance.  Nose is of smoked malt and somehow a touch of fruit.  Body is nicely smoked with an oily mouthfeel.  Touches of roast are also prevalent.  Good amount of alcohol, but overall comes up a bit light.  Nice smoked beer nonetheless.
",5
1822,"The first time I had this it wasnt very smokey, but had some nice leafy hop flavours.  The second and all subsequent times those hop notes were gone, but we had a dry smokiness and burnt notes in their place.
",1
1823,"Along with Diamond Knot and Bhagwans, this is the third member of my IPA Holy Trinity.  Huge citrus flavours, appetizing bitterness, trance-inducing aromas...oh man....just thinking about this beer...oh lord.  Excuse me, I need to go to the fridge now.
",5
1824,"Hand-pump at Sailor HagarsCloudy golden color; nice creamy head. Light fruity aroma. Low carbonation, smooth mouthfeel, good malt and blond caramel flavor, correct bitterness, with hints of hop qualities; shades of toffee in the end. Highly drinkable session beer.
",1
1825,"Yawn. Pale ales can be boring as it is, and this one falls into that general pool of beer. Take it or leave it; its not bad but its not great either.
",1
1826,"Butterscotch almost overshadows the toasted, biscuity malts in the nose with no hop aromas apparent.  Lightly hazy copper coloured body is topped by a thick and lasting cream coloured head that recedes to a lasting cover with some lacing.  Lots of butterscotch in the flavour also though floral hops and biscuity malts are notable as well.  Bitterness is subdued.  Medium body with moderate carbonation.  Sampled on tap with Oakes and CapFlu at Sailor Hagars in North Van in May 2007.
",1
1827,"(650ml bottle) Purchased at the Sailor Hagars Off-Sale for ~$5. Pours a lasting white foamy head with a deep orange. Nose of orangey english hops. Bitter and lightly fruity flavour. Solid to style.
",1
1828,"Bottle. Hazy amber, low white head. Honeyish (wild heather) and minerally aroma. Solid mouthfeel, bready and strawlike malt, spicy, yeasty minerally notes, herbal and earthy hop balance - they are english allright. Very nice, just what I needed right now. Thanks for bringing it over to the Island Josh!
",5
1829,"This one is now being brewed on contract for Sailor Hagars in North Vancouver.  Nice copper colour with a thin white lace.  Caramel malt and a nice citrus and spicy hop character to balance it out.  Soft mouthfeel and a bit of toffee/caramel becomes prominent in the finish.
",1
1830,"Amber body with an orangey hop nose.  Head is really creamy. Flavour is thin but lasts.  A nice light beer that can be an easy drinker.
",1
1831,"Yeasty aroma.  Mild, stale bitterness with a sweet finish.  I found this to be under hopped and boring.
",5
1832,"Amber color. Grapefruity hop nose.Flavor has a long finish, but not particularly strong.
",1
1833,"Cloudy orange appearance.  Citrusy hop, irony aroma. Quite bitter, good long hop palate.  Quite like the Bengal.
",1
1834,"Amber coloured. Medium bodied, well balanced with big bitterness. Flowery with citrus aroma
",5
1835,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2005 In the early Hagars days, this beer was a showcase for BC Kent Goldings.  A couple of batches were among the finest APAs Ive ever had.  Then that hop disappeared from the landscape and the beer became more of a standard-issue EPA similar to many others in the region.  Today, its a golden-amber ale with light bitterness, a faint papaya note, light maltiness, a hint of minerals.  Rather light overall, but with nice balance and complexity.  A subtle but enjoyable brew.  Of all the current Hagars brews, this seems to best evidence a shift from Gary Lohin to Howe Sound as it is crafted much the same as the HS beers.
",1
1836,"Very watery. Balanced malt/hop flavours with a light maple flavour which is more prominant in the aftertaste.
",1
1837,"On tap at Sailor Hagars. Pours a solid amber with creamy white head that lasts to the bottom of the glass. Aroma has pine and grapefruit/citrus hop notes. Flavour is also very hoppy but with enough toffee malt character to balance it out. Lingering bitterness. Decent but a tad underwhelming.
",1
1838,"Draught at Sailor HagarsGolden color; creamy head. The aroma is lightly fruity, at least this one has some aroma, from Sailor Hagars. The mouthfeel is quite dry, but there is a good toffee flavor, a very strong bitterness, with a good share of hop oils and resins, and bitter orange peel. Solid.
",5
1839,"650ml Bottle purchased at Sailor Hagars. Beer has good body and hop bitterness. Pronounced grapefruit flavour. Overall, this is an enjoyable IPA and more than worth trying.
",5
1840,"The Sailor Hagars IPA was undoubtedly better when it was brewed on premises in North Vancouver. However, it remains one of the finest BC IPAs. Reddish-orange color. Strong nose with distinct hops and grapefruit notes. Citrusy throughout the bouquet and the taste too.
",5
1841,"(Draught) I found that they were sold all out of the bottled version so I was lucky to find this on tap. Pours a thin, beige head with an orange-amber body. Nose and flavour of sweet English malts and bitter PNW hoppiness. By far the best beer at the Hagar. Too bad the bar is SO unimpressive...
",1
1842,"Was one of my faves when it was made by Gary Lohin. It was BCs best IPA.  I still like it but the recipe has been tweaked by Fab & Franco at Howe Sound. Heres a secret - all the contract brews at Sailor Hagars are exactly whats on tap at Howe Sound - just a different name.  Compare the ratings! That said, its  served with a creamy head, great lace, hops now less citrusy than before, thinner in the mouth.
",5
1843,"An orange beer with a thin beige head. The aroma is sweet hoppy with hints of caramel. The flavor is nicely hoppy, and the alcohol burns slightly on the tongue.
",5
1844,"Very light orange, off-white head. Floral and piney nose, sweaty average floral hops hide most of the maltiness. Barky, lasting oily hops bitterness, woody and annoying. Light bodied feels mysteriously sticky. Average..
",1
1845,"Floral, honey, earth, lavender hops with underlying biscuity, toasty malts in the nose.  Clear copper coloured body is topped by a low white head that diminishes to partial cover with light lacing.  Moderate hop bitterness with floral, lavender hop flavour over a clean malt character.  Medium body with fair carbonation and soft bubbles in the mouth.  Bottle enjoyed with Oakes, Rastacouere, St-Eric and Ungstrup.
",5
1846,"Amber in colour with a nice sized off-white head.  Aroma is hoppy and lightly malty.  Flavour is nice and hoppy with a little earthiness to it.  Nice bitter end.
",5
1847,"Light amber in color with a hoppy aroma. Fairly bitter taste with light hop aroma for an IPA.
",1
1848,"Creamy white head that lasts to the bottom of the glass.  Rich amber colour.  Huge pine and grapefruit/citrus hop aroma.  Flavour is also very hoppy but with enough toffee malt character to balance it out.  Lingering bitterness.  I enjoyed this one a great deal.
",5
1849,"Again, I drank this beer last week at Sailor Hagars.  		An excellent balance of grapefruity hops and tobacco notes, ending juicy and bitter with notes of apples.
",5
1850,"Cloudy amber,lasting beige head.Grapefruit hop nose. Tart grapefruit hop flavor, with mild, lingering green hop finish.Great lace. Poorly balanced.
",1
1851,"Light orange color.  Citrusy hop aroma and body, smooth.  Very bitter palate.  Sweet backgroud.  Finishes smooth and long.  Nice, similar but a bit better than that Narwhal.
",5
1852,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2005 One of four IPAs Gary Lohin made, probably about the third one to hit the market but ultimately the one thats been made in the past few years. A shame, since Star of India was the best, and Monsoon was better than this one as well. I never did get to try Dean Carrieres IPA, at least not brewed by Hagars.  Regardless, Bengal is the IPA that Howe Sound makes.  Unlike the Narwhal and ESB, its served cold from the keg.  Bright golden-amber colour.  Moderately hopped.  The other IPAs were hopped to PNW standards, this is more like to BC standards, though at the high end of that scale.  Slight chewiness from crystal malt, overlayed with resiny bitterness.  The aroma is woody hops and fresh biscuity malts.
",5
1853,"Watery yellow appearance with a light hoppy nose but the body isnt overly thin. Mostly hop flavours with a light hoppy aftertaste.
",1
1854,"This was quite hoppy as mst IPAs but it was a bit over board.  The aroma was much better than the taste.
",1
1855,"The most assertive IPA at Hagars, and thus the most assertive IPA in Canada.  Like eating a handful of hops.
",1
1856,"Amber, no discernable bubbles. More hops then malt with long finish.
",1
1857,"Has a peppery sweet malty nose, a medium body and a sweet rye-whiskey type finish .
",5
1858,"Amber body with a lasting small head.  Nose was roasted malts and alcohol.  Nutty and floral taste with an avergae finish.  Good but not great.
",1
1859,"Deep amber, lasting off white head.Roasty malt nose.Nutty choc malt taste with slight cloying yeast
",1
1860,"Roasty, nutty, and chocolatey with floral hop flavours in the finish.
",5
1861,"Assertive, yet balanced, woody bitterness.
",5
1862,"Gold with huge lasting off white head. Crisp hop nose. Fatty taste with light lingering hop finish
",1
1863,"Golden, slight haze; scant aroma - maybe some hop.  Mostly cold-tasting, they really need to serve this warmer, because all I got were some husky malt flavours and vague herbal hoppiness.  The brewer told me he brought in special pale malts from a small German producer and they were wonderful malts, etc...they were completely lost on me, and I know Gary can brew so its not for lack of talent.  But if theyre lost on me, theyll be lost on just about everyone else, too, which is a shame because I dont want discourage brewers from seeking out the best ingredients possible.
",1
1864,"Cascade-accented, and well balanced.  I would put it ahead of Anchor myself, but I dont have any illusions about converting the masses on that one.
",5
1865,"Sample at brewpub. Pours a dark brown colour with thin ring of off white foam. Aroma has some prominent malt but lacks a nuttiness. Taste is reasonably malty but again the nutiness is lacking. Okay.
",1
1866,"Hand-pump at Sailor HagarsBrown color, creamy head. Light caramel and very light butterscotch aroma. The body is weaker than expected, there is caramel flavor, low bitterness. The hand-pump allows for lower carbonation, which is better for me. Simple but easy to drink
",1
1867,"Bought as a bottle quite awhile ago. Lives up to its name quite well, lots of nutty flavour in this one, some malts, but really too nutty a flavour for my tastes. Comes across as a little artificial, and low alcohol content doesnt help me to get tipsy to enjoy it more either. Still okay, just not great.
",1
1868,"Decent nut brown: not sweet as some can be, but then again its not got any distinctive flavors either. Quaffable and pretty good.
",1
1869,"(650ml bottle) Purchased at the Sailor Hagars Off-Sale for ~$5. Lasting foamy almond-coloured head with a ruby body. Pleasant roasteed malt and slight coffee flavours. This is a good contender. I like the solid beers made by Howe Sound.
",1
1870,"Very dark porterish colour with ruby and mahogany notes.  Has a thin light brown head.  Sweet blackstrap molasses and treacle aroma.  A vineous sherry-like aroma.  Cherry and black current fruitiness with port-like notes as well.  Not like any other brown ale that Ive had.  Tends to become cloying, but is still a well-crafted beer.  Based on the description Im reading I think this is a totally different beast from what others were drinking when it was still brewed at Sailor Hagars.
",5
1871,"Dark brown body with little head.  Flavour is nice and nutty but a little thin.  Finish is dry.
",1
1872,"Deep amber colour.  Dry nutty flavour.  Medium bodied.  Unimpressive.

1873,"Brown with off white head.Faint malt nose. Light malt faintly nutty flavor with short dry finish
",1
1874,"Dark brown colour, light body, palate is also light, malt-accented, some nuttiness and drying out in the finish.
",1
1875,"Interesting brown ale.  Sweet malty aroma.  Good malty backbone, end with a good hop bite and a pleasing sweetness.  Nice.
",5
1876,"I appreciate the attempt at a style that is not brewed enough in the new world--or old, for that matter. Not an exceptional example of a Vienna lager, the Hagars/Howe Sound version is nevertheless solid and refreshing and worth a try.
",1
1877,"Amber in color with a light hoppy aroma. Fairly balanced malt/hops, not much of anything happening here though.
",1
1878,"Light orange colour with off white head.  Decent malts with a hoppy taste.  Found the finish to be a bit bitter.  Not overly impressed.

1879,"Very light orange colour.  Light carmel malt flavour.
",5
1880,"Amber with off white head.Nice malt profile with some decent hops in the finish.
",1
1881,"Amber coloured. medium bodied, lightly roasty. Youre right, Oakes, this is better than the beers it has been named after.
",5
1882,"This beer has evolved from an tasty malt-accented Vienna to a tasty hop-accented one. Ive had a lot of amber lagers from Scandinavia and this is better than any of them (ok, except maybe Appollo from Copenhagen).
",1
1883,"Sampled at brewpub. Pours a murky yellow with a thin head and some lacing. Aroma is of clove and coriander with some citrus. Malt seems funky. Taste is flooded with orange and coriander. Crisp finish with a slightly bready aftertaste. Not bad.
",5
1884,"Draught at Sailor HagarsGolden color, hazy. The aroma is light; there is light caramel flavor, quite dry, with a shade of toffee. Drinkable Ale, though the last thing I would associate it to is a Wit.
",1
1885,"Not a bad version of this style, which can be thin and boring. Quite tasty yet mild: not a big beer but a full-flavored example of a summer quaffer.
",5
1886,"(Draught) Sampled at Sailor Hagars in North Vancouver, BC, on June 20, 2006. Lasting white foam head with an unfiltered yellow body. Nose of pleasant ripe bananas. Mild creamy clove flavour beneath a light banana tongue and rose oil. It is hot and I am thirsty... this hits the spot sufficiently.
",1
1887,"Cloudy yellow colored beer with a thin head. Aroma is of clove and coriander with notes of citrus and maltl. Overwhelming  orange and coriander flavour. Too sweet and watery for a wheatbeer
",1
1888,"Fresh and creamy, as if from the tap today. A great super-creamy malt with some bitters and dried aftertaste. A bit of citrussy banana fruit and spice but not taking away from its simplicity.
",5
1889,"Cloudy light yellow in color with a sweet spicy banana aroma. Spicy citrus banana flavours, dry.

1890,"From a 660 ml bottle.  Pale yellow, slightly cloudy with a thin head and some lacing.  Aroma is of clove and coriander with some citrus over an unusual malt smell.  Seems like this is mostly barley malt rather than wheat.  Huge orange flavour with a good amount of coriander in the finish.  Crisp finish with a slightly bready aftertaste.  A pretty good brew.

1892,"I visited this brewpub in July - surely it can't have closed down?  It was great!  I really enjoyed their wit beer, very refreshing, but more importantly very tasty, with bright. chalky notes.  One of the best beers I tried in Canada.

1895,"A wonderful beer.  Nice orange and fresh corriander nose floating on top of a nicely carbonated wheat spiciness.  Not as phenolic as I prefer, but still the beer that made that first big impact on me so long ago.  Still the best brewpub in town.

1901,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2005 This beer rose to popularity when it was one of Garys best brews.  These days, its fallen on hard times.  Hazy yellow colour.  Fairly fruity (peach), phenolic aroma.

1913,"UPDATED: JAN 17, 2004 At its best, it is very complex with notes of vanilla, chocolate, steamed milk, cherry, apple pie and brandy.  Early editions were reminiscent of the classic 1995 Tall Ship No.1 . Since that beer has left us (well, not me, I stocked up), this is now Canada""s best barley wine.1998 Vintage, aged 6 years - Dark red; slightly toasty, smokey and malty aroma.  Rich brown sugar notes, depth of oily, maltiness.  Fruity, and warm.  This was the definitive vintage for this beer, and I hope Gary Lohin revives the recipe at his new brewery.  A 2000 vintage served 2 years old on cask was a little less complex, yeastier, and more mellow - I never had this one fresh so I won""t change my rating based on this.

The nose isnt too strong, some light fennel and fruit; goya melon, peach, grape, some moderate koji and light alcohol. The flavor has a very light impact and it flows fairly smoothly down the old palate. A long tail with a dry apple/licorice note and a fairly nice overall impression. Clean, but enough flavor to wallop near the end. Could be a bit more floral in the nose. Heats the stomach after drinking a few sips.

Further Personal Perceptions:	-A sheet of foam tops the veiled amber blond.	-Carbonation is quite fierce, increasing drinkability, but perhaps impeding on some flavors.	-The leafy hops offer some bitterness as well.	-The malts develop some caramel sweetness as well.	-The body is lean and well fed.

Mild-medium bitterness with some dry orange skin and some grapefruit in the finish.  Light body, medium carbonation.  Typical brewpub light entry-level APA.  No defaults or anything but recommendable only on a very hot summer day.  Next batches might be better because this work-in-progress beer is a collaboration between the brewpub/brewer and a Sherbrooke engineering student group called Sherbroue and each new batch is supposed to improve on the previous one.  Lets just hope that in a few years from they dont build bridges using the same try-and-errors approach.

1941,"In short: A bright and crisp hoppy blonde Ale.  Refreshing and tasty.	How: Tap at brewpub	The look: Partly cloudy golden blonde body topped by a small beige head	In long: The hoppy nose shows a wide range of hops aroma: tangy, leafy, pine-tree.  Nice toasted malts bill, clean and crunchy.  Sweetness is in between honey and caramel.  Generously hopped with fruity hops (orange peels, light grapefruits, light citrus) and a touch of pine-tree.  The bitterness of medium intensity and the finish is relatively dry.  Perfectly levelled medium carbonation.  Tasty beer that could pass as an IPA.  I had a couple of pints of this and I wanted more but had to leave the town to go back home.  This beer grew on me like a bad case of acne.

Great aroma, I got hit by the resinous, piney hops up front, then something a bit more peppery and a solid caramel aroma that comes up from behind. Taste is quite bitter and spicy, lots of peppery hops, some lemon flavors and cookie dough sweetness. Carbonation is quite lively which leaves the palate quite refeshed. Apparently inspired by SN Pale ale, it is definately american tasting.

Large white head, sticky at that. Fresh palate. Pleasant hay-like pils malt extraction. The hops are sliding on the tongue, going straight to your nasal cavity to provide their floral grapefruity trick.

But I got the impression this was not the freshest batch as the hop profile was muted.	-The finish wasnt too sweet, but the hops couldnt keep up to balance everything out.	-Alcohol was barely perceptible, which I appreciate.	-In the same strong brew category, I would definitely go for their Barley Wine every time over this.

1956,"My Bottom Line:	Fieldberries and diplomatic caramel coexist peacefully, while earthy, leafy hops gather to conclude this super clean Scotch Ale.		Further Personal Perceptions:	-A sheet of foam sinks into the mahogany-laced dark brown.	-The aroma is too timid for the style; a little more age might have improved it, as I think this batch (at 7.2% abv) was served quite young.	-The fruitiness also develops grape-like flavors.	-Malts also become biscuity in the middle, diversifying the flavor profile.	-This is as well brewed as all Siboire beers. This brewer is very professional and I secretly wish the quality of his execution will inspire other brewers in the Sherbrooke area.	-For this Scotch Ale to stand out in its own category, I think it would have to have a slightly longer caramel malt finish, as well as a more inviting nose.

1957,"Large beige head covers the hazy copper. Sugary and warming aroma despite the not too exuberant 6.5% ABV. The fruity, alcoholic and sweet flavour profile clearly belongs to a scotch ale though. Thick-bodied, soft and creamy, remarkably velvety texture. Candy reminiscent nose, not unlike Qubecs Sucre dOrge. A texture beer really. A warming, soft and foamy presence in the mouth, concealing a earthy, slightly peaty malt base. Gentle cherry juiciness on top of red licorice complexifies the ensemble.

A ton of foresty and resinous hops.  Finish is medium bitter and medium dry.  Its the overall sensation of crispness/freshness that really makes this brew.  To call it highly drinkable would be an understatement.  You cannot get enough of a crisp, tasty and semi-dry IPA like this.

Further Personal Perceptions:	-A ring of foam crowns the nearly clear honeyed amber.	-Carbonation is quite effervescent, increasing drinkability.	-The honeyed maltiness becomes caramelly at times.	-The grapefruit personality is bursting throughout, offering juiciness and a tantalizing perfume. Very impressive.	-This is as super clean as all Siboire beers.

Unfortunately, it is not my favourite hop profile, but it is certainly well integrated. The pale malts underneath are a mix between bread and biscuit in there flavour development. Limited crystal proportion makes it dry and refreshing rather than sweet and clashing. Fresh and crafty IPA.

1983,"<b>In short: </b>A golden lager hopped like an citrusy Pale Ale.	<b>How: </b>Tap at brewpub (oct 2008).  First batch ever.	<b>The look: </b>Partly cloudy dark golden body topped by a very small white head	<b>In long: </b>Citrusy nose very atypical for an Oktoberfest.  Taste and body has that chewy true unfiltered lager sensation with a lot of juicy citrusy hops that felt very much like a Pale Ale.  A bit bready, not much caramel/honey/other sweetness flavours.  Smooth body, smooth carbonation.  Closer in style to the Maibocks then the Oktoberfests Ive had.  The end-result is a nice refreshing citrusy lager but as an Oktoberfest it is as spot on one GW Bush assessment of the situation in well, anything.

1996,"Pitch black. Excellent lacing atop the small and quite dark, tan head. A clean and expressive stout with a strong dark malt preminence. Roasted grain dominated profile, though not chocolatey, all grains. Certainly coffee-like and even hinting at liquorice, but this was much drier than I anticipated. Not a sweet dessert stout despite the use of oatmeal. Just a very easy-drinking, dry black beer with a light-medium body. No-nonsense. This could have been my favourite of the 6 Ive tried from Siboire, but the carbonation held an overly agressive bite to me, really pointy. Otherwise excellent.

1999,"Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub with the brewer. This one came in at 10%, a little less boozy than last year i am told. Better than the oaked version I am told.

2000,"In short: A big creamy, caramelized and well hoped barley wine.  Too easy to drink	How: Tap at brewpub	The look: Cloudy light brown body topped by a very small beige head	In long: Nose has plenty of caramel, leafy and resinous hops.  That beer smells big.  Taste has a lot of rich creamy oily caramel, like a crme caramel.  Some toffee.  Cake maltiness with some sort of banana cake flavour in the back.  Generously hopped with a whole lot of leafy and slightly resinous hops.  Nice mouthfeel with the full body and medium carbonation.  I like a well hopped drinkable big barley wine that avoids being boozy and sugary/syrupy.  Surprisingly drinkable for a 10.5% monster.  Nothing fancy or very complex here, but like a starving child in a Cambodian Nike factory, it really gets the job done.

2014,"Totally clear, very pale scintillating golden. Tight white cover leaving convincing lacing. A rather surprising appearance for a beer that claims its inspiration from the like of Westmalle Tripel, but the aroma feels more authentic than the clearness. The two most obvious aromas got to be honey and alcohol. They are backed by a firm cerealic pils malt base though, so the ensemble avoids the meady path that some less refined tripels take. Nicely warming. Fairly phenolic. Floral, very soft noble hops. A touch of peppery spiciness, maybe even a subtle coriander spicing - could also be grains of paradise is noticed. Id tend to think it was more of a yeast side-effect. The spicy feel enhances the otherwise overly smooth bitterness. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation for the style. A fine tripel, possibly my favourite from a Quebec brewpub.

Biscuity, toasty (and quite cerealic with a certain depth in that department) malt base supports the hop show going on above it all. While not the most perfumey IPA, this boasts a confident sprucey carnival, adorned with orangey notions aplenty. In mouth, their importance is magnified. The hops grow by the sip, entangling the back of the tongue with a rich bitterness, resinous, citrusy, insisting at length. Fresh, tasty and balanced by a full, engagingly carbonated palate. Exemplary IPA, possibly better than any bottled Qubec IPA.

This beer shines even from the other end of the room. 	-This is one of those examples where nitro actually enhances interesting malt sugars and fuses them to fruity hop characteristics.

Deeply vinous profile marries bot the strong grapey, blackberry profile with the alcohol warmth. Almost no bitterness noticeable. The hops are drowned under the malts, which nevertheless never appear overly sweet, certainly not cloying. A bit of higher alcohols are part of the game though, as headache enducing rubbery/pasticy undertones are felt in the background. Nothing major though, excellently integrated fruity goodness.

I dislike:	If the bock had not been so good, I would have gone for a 2nd pint.

2076,"In short: An aromatic and uber-hoppy golden ale that remains very smooth refreshing.   Excellent	How: Cask at Benelux, Montreal	The look: Cloudy golden orange body topped by a small off-white head	In long: The smooth and very aromatic nose boasts fresh flowery hops perfume and citrus fruits.  Taste has a chewy bready pale malt body.  Malts provide body but hops provide all the flavors.  Lots of hops juice, some oranges, flowers.  This was almost a hop-bomb, but a very smooth hop bomb with the hops focussing on aromas and also refreshing and not-so-bitter flavors.  I honestly dont have a clue what makes this a California Common, a style I seem to understand less and less, just one of many many things I dont understand.  Ok, so Ive got a lot of ignorance, now wheres the bliss thats supposed to come with it.
",5
2077,"My Bottom Line:	The softest of mouthfeels showcases this brews toasted cereals, themselves cushions that propel a seductive spicy hop perfume.		Further Personal Perceptions:	-A sheet of foam covers the hazy amber.	-The dry-hopped nose is perhaps linear, but it is saliva-enducing.	-The chosen hops are perfectly harmonious with the toasted, bready malt signature.	-Balance and drinkability are excellent. 	-I dont know if they can reproduce the same flavor comfort on regular keg carbonation, but I am willing to be the guinea pig when that happens. This cask was heavenly.		On cask at Benelux.

In the glass its very pale, with very little carbonation. Its 8% abv, and this is well disguised. The taste is of apples and a slight peachyness. Quite sweet, mellowing out in the finish.

Bought this to cook with, based on the price and small bottle size ( 300 mL ), and got pretty much what I expected...not bilge water but not something Id drink either.

2289,"Thanks to ilovedarkbeer for this nice one. Clear body with strong legs left on the glass. Aroma of rice and wrotten pineapple. Tastee is sweet, but a bit watery at 14.5% and a little watery. Kind of a buttery mouthfeel. Very smooth drinking.

2290,"Pours a pale yellow color that is brilliant and clear. Super smooth, to the point of being like sugar water. I was amazed by the smoothness. Notice the acidity levels in the description, anyone who does not give this beer a 4 or 5 on palate is a fool. Taste is sweet, dry, a bit fruity and very ricey. I liked this one but was not super impressed in the taste department.

2291,"300mL Bottle: Clear color, nose is sweet with light koji and grainy notes, a bit of alcohol. The flavor is nutty and a bit acidic and harsh but not completely bad. Moderate alcohol, harsh koji and a noticed lack of fruity melon characteristics and a buttery mouthfeel. Decent, but not that great. the line between the two is large.

2292,"Quite drinkable, and my favorite sake of about 4 tried so far. Quite like the unpasteurized one I had, this is delightfully sweet (walnut nut meat) and flowery. Very drinkable. The aroma components I just plain old can't get to (too much alcohol) but that alcohol presence is really barely detectable in the flavor. Yes!

2309,"Bottle shared by Eric. Now Ive had plenty of Sake when I lived in Japan, but I never really liked it much- or at least not as much as beer. But I am branching out, and this quality brew was very nice. Pours a crystal clear color. The aroma and the flavor were dominated by sweet apples and pear. It was very oily and flavorful. Quite nice. Very warm as Sake tends to be. I am really not qualified to rate a Sake, but I will re-rate all of my early tries later when I hopefully know more.

2310,"Bottle thanks to tytoanderso, I have now found this available at local stores. Pours clear and water like hue, very pure, with strongish legs.

With notes of nuts, vanilla, light umami, rose petals, lychee and concord grapes. Very nice and extremely light alcohol presence (btw, my bottle read 15%, not 16.5%). Viscous and full bodied, yet refreshing. Very, very pleasant.		Paired exceptionally with cavaillon melon.

2314,"Bottle: Pours a crystal clear color with light legs but a shimmering character. The nose is bright and fruity, lots of pear and anise, some alcohol and light coconut.

2316,"Im surprised to find this on the website! Parksys wife found this at the Medicine Hat Farmers Market, of all places. Extremely pale yellow, almost uncoloured. Aroma is sweet and FULL of sulphites. Yech! Flavour is the same: non-descript sweetness overwhelmed by sulphites. This reminded me of when my father made homemade kiwi-fruit wine when I was a kid. Im sure it will find its fans, but this didnt win anyone over in my kitchen. The whole bottle got dumped into the sink.

Let us also be politically incorrect by prying the cap with an Efes bottle opener. Yeek! Smell of skunk and piss in the green bottle. Doesnt let up in the glass, but instead airs out some adjuncts. Still, a clear golden yellow with a tight white head. Well, what did I expect for the price. Taste is corn additives knocked back with bittering agents. Each swallow makes me worry about this stuff. I notice the label doesnt go to the pretext of reprinting any medals from old beer festivals.

Similarly bready and honey-sweet in the nose, grainy, casually smoky, but just a hint of hops.  Medium-bodied and nicely balanced on the palate with medium carbonation.  Golden-yellow in color with slight haziness.  The off-white head rises to an inch on the pour, then settles to a broken film and wide ring.  Some spotty lace is left on the glass.  A very flavorful and pleasing bohemian pilsener that stands up to a good many of the authentic releases from the Czech Republic.

The hops are earthy and slightly spicy.  ACK!!	This beer is a sweet mess of malts, adjuncts, chemicals and green bottle skunk, finished with a touch of hops.

2352,"Green bottle. Aroma of grassy hop backed by a bit of sweet malt. Brassy gold color with a pretty good size white head. Thin to medium body with coarsely creamy carbonation. Good feel.

",1
2353,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2009 This was surprisingly good.  Its dark gold with a medium, dense off-white head that slowly shrinks and leaves a little lacing.  The aroma is a strong, pungent pale lager aroma first of sweet grain & malt, then flowery pine, leaves, with hints of crackers and a typical light hint of skunk.  The taste is also a strong pale lager taste, with a sweetish malty start then a faintly meaty, pungent pine-herbal-grass hop taste and bitterness that really dominates the drink for the rest of the time and is quite nice.  After a while, as it warms a bit, there is a faint soapy metallic quality, but this is not noticeable if one drinks it cold or does not linger on it, instead letting the sharp herbally hops dominate.  The body becomes a little watery as it warms.  In the end, it is quite good.  It goes well with food.

2354,"Strong grassy hops abound and are detected from a great distance. Hints of dry pale and caramel malt. As the hops fade, there seems to very little left. Golden liquid with a moderate off-white head and nice lace.  Solid, yet, somewhat grain malt in the front that give way to a herbal grassy bitterness in the middle. Finishes slightly crisp, but there is a touch of metal/mineral that distracts in the linger. Certainly not one of the worst euro strongs out there.

2403,"***old review from 2007***	Poured out a big foamy off white head, left some random messy lacing on top of a slightly hazy solid gold / slight amber brew. The aroma was nice and seemed warm. Slightly spicy (different) yeast, interesting malts and a bit fruity. The taste is pretty fine with good malts and some slightly spicy yeast. Comes across quite smooth and light with a good after taste with a light but lengthy bitter lingering. Is this stuff still even sold here anymore?

2404,"Bottle from Ts in Tempe, AZ. Light amber color with a foamy beige head. Grassy/fruity hop aromas. Near medium body with frothy carbonation. Its not all that bitter, but it has the malt balanced by noble? hop. Finishes astringent. Another unique brew. Are not they all?

2405,"16 oz. bottle in trade from douglas88- thanks!  Served in shaker- poured transparent yellow with copper tint, one finger white head formed, tried to lace, and tried to stay, but was unsuccessful at both attempts.  Aroma of wheat, grass, and corn.  Hits the mouth with a thin watery body, some malt, some corn, a little sweetness with hops on the background on the finish.

2407,"Courtesy Secret Santa. Calling this ""premium"" is a stretch; I would label it pale lager but what do I know. Aroma was weak. Light malt is faint. Pour was a light gold with a one finger white head. Taste was blah. Sugar water, metal and light malt with a sticky sweet aftertaste and little carbonation. I will forgive this beer since it made a long trip here in a green bottle.

2408,"Pretty lousy.  Slightly rotten vegetable matter aroma.  Funky bad flavor with an aftertaste of car exhaust.

2409,"Bottle (thanks mom!). Golden with a big white head that diminishes slowly - looks pretty good! Aroma is rather grainy with a bit of hoppy notes and maybe some grassy hints. Sweetish flavor with a rather bitter finish with some hops and metallic hints. Light to medium body. Pretty clean and drinkable.

2413,"Bottle. High white and lasting head.  Clear golden body. Sour grapefuit like aroma.  Dry hops bitterness and not the expected sweetness. Amazed about the low ratings. Nothing special but on the other hand not bad.

2415,"In the glass it was an unimpressive pale golden color, but the musty rotten or fremented fruit aroma was very unique.  Flavor is surprising original for a lager, full-bodied with hints of the aroma showing through.  Finish was a little bitter, but not unusual for this style.  I enjoyed this botte down to the last drop, and believe this beer officially puts Armenia on the beer map.  Dont expect to be blown away, but truly a nice beer.  Cheers.

2419,"Bottle, bought in Massachusetts, USA.  Light yellow colour with a small head. Grainy skunky aroma with some hops. Flavour is grainy, thin, little sweetness, little maltiness and some hops. Not really that god but worth a try. So far the only beer I have tasted from Armenia.
",1
2420,"This was in an international mixed pack from United Distributors. Golden yellow with a decent sized head that laced the entire depth of the glass. Sweet floral and green hop aroma. Same on the palate with nice pale malt evident and a little salty and bitter finish. Actually very enjoyable indeed, and in my opinion worthy of ""premium lager"" status. A pleasant surprise.

2421,"Green bottle. Dark yellow. Big bubbled head. Aroma does start out a little off but then settles into a trong straw and vegetable nose. Attractive sweet body and strong hop flavour. Better than expected from country #73.

2422,"Bottle... Clear, light yellow lager with a small, creamy, white head. The aroma is at first skunky, then that fades and notes of honey and white pepper come through. Medium sweet flavor with almost no hop presence. Light-bodied with mostly flat carbonation. Sweet finish. This knocks Armenia off my list. Thanks to argo0 for sharing!

2423,"12oz, courtesy of argo0.  Pours a medium head with little retention, big bubbles around the edges; filtered yellowish-golden.

2428,"Hard to get excited about this.  A pale lager with very little bitterness, not much malt, and a thin mouth feel.  Pale golden lager with a small white head.  Best feature is a significant degree of floral hops.  But it was served in a charming little bistro overlooking the harbor in Newport Beach California, and I was delighted to find something that was not Bud or Miller.

2434,"12oz green bottle. Sampled at the Lynnwood International Swill Fest. Fizzy yellow beer color. Small head. Aroma is malt, grain and fruit, touch of corn as well. A medium bodied Pale lager. Malts are fruity and VERY sweet. Slightly spicy hops. Kinda sweet, kinda thin, kinda flat, and kind Cornish. Not terrible, but nothing above a cookie cutter Euro Pale Lager either. There is a sweetish aftertaste that is kind of objectionable. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is sweetish.
",1
2435,"This beer was sampled during the fabled Lynnwood International Swill Fest. It pours a clear golden yellow color with a soapy white head and small amounts of lacing...the stereotypical fizzy yellow beer. Without a doubt we were horrified from the start by the green bottle. The aroma is malty, somewhat hoppy, with corn, wheat, grass and perhaps banana....strange. The flavor is light bodied and cloyingly sweet in the finish with a malty but heavily corny mixture taking over. Definitely not a very appealing beer, but I imagine itd be much worse. It does have its fair share of skunked qualities, but again, not as bad as expected. Low carbonation levels.

2442,"Interesting perhaps. Dark for a premium lager. Opening the bottle is like being sprayed by a family of skunks.  Taste is mild with hops and carries a sweet, bread like malt taste. Not as offensive as I expected. I feel bad that the small store ordered like 9 million bottles of this, but has me wondering if there may be an Armenian community in my city..Sounds cool to me.
",1
2443,"Slightly hazed golden color with a moderate off white head. Some lace. Toasted bread, mild herb and grass and some fresh pizza dough thrown in the aroma mix. Fairly thin in feel. Mild toasted malt flavors, mingle with dusty floral hops. Has a vienna flavor to it. A bit to sweet.
",1
2444,"k, mine was skunked.  only a little, but seemed dusty and old, but some of the flavor made its way through, which was kind of yeasty with a little malt following.
",1
2445,"Poured a clear pale yellow with a decent white head. The nose had a malty sweetness ending with a light mustiness. The taste started with biscuit like malts and a sweet/spicy feel with a hint of hops. The finish was dry with a mild bitterness mixed with some sweet malts. Its OK, not that bad, but one 12 ounce bottle was more than enough.

",1
2452,"Initial aroma was Heineken skunk but mellowed to a wort-like malty concoction. Thin, soap sud-like head. Cloudy, light orange appearance. Odd, tart flavor - hard to put my finger on it - similar to many Russian lagers I have had. Slightly fruity, slightly malty. Surprised to see this categorized as a Pilsener - too rough around the edges in my opinion with a bit of bitterness. Mouthfeel is good - goes down smooth with no aftertaste - surprising considering the bitterness.
",1
2453,"Initial big malty lager aroma, but there's a grating gamey quality to it after a while. Dry, with a strong vanilla marking.  An odd residual bittering -- like green olives around the pit. (Not the vegetable quality, just the bitterness.) The brown-green bottle appears to be enough to combat the skunking -- since the '6-pack' that this came in was shrinkwrapped plastic -- although the bottle had a nasty ridge at the mouth, just where it ought to be nice and smooth.  Medium straw beer, clingy milkshake foam. Underwhelming.
",1
2454,"Points for the fact that we can get it here. More for the fact that it wasn't skunky through light strike or bottle age. Having said that it was just a lager, not much of a pilsener character. Well presented like most beers that are reasonably fresh. Clean palate without being brilliant.

2455,"Skunky nose (green bottle), Yellow and fizzy. Not much going on here, some dryness at the finish. Bland.

(It had been expired for five years) Very oxidized flavor. Gained some metallic/musty bitterness. Somewhat watery mouth feel with a toasted, mildly chocolaty malt character. Seems like it possessed a decent malt profile, but the rating suffered due to the heavy oxidation. Not bad though.

2471,"Bottle... Mostly clear, dark, burgundy lager with a large, frothy, khaki head. Terrific, tight retention. Oxidized, ester-riddled nose permeates must, cobwebs, dates, dust and very, very light molasses. Tastes much better than expected. Hints at malt sweetness with an undertone of caramel, but mainly delivers moderate acidity and mild bitterness. Medium to full-bodied and lightly creamy with soft carbonation. Crisp, tangy finish.

2472,"Undated bottle drunk on 8/10/06.Medium-high to high clarity in this bronze/tan-tinted dark brown beer.  Some light burgundy tresses when held to the light.  Off-white/beige head is initially retained at about one-finger, but rapidly fades to a ring, with fizzy carbonation running about in the liquid.  No lacing.Oxidation, DMS, soggy, nutty, stale malts, some light metallic character and plenty of pasteurization in the nose.  So thats nice.  Zippy bitterness on the end, but it almost seems more carbonic and artificially derived, not very hop-like.  Some soft brown sugar notes, rather putrid toffee/caramel and almost no yeast apparency, perhaps some acetyldehyde.  Well, that will be about enough of that.The flavor is somewhat oxidized, with a cardboard flavor.  Sickly sweet, almost syrupy, underattenuated malt sugars are simple and find no balance.  My friend mentioned the whole tea aspect, so its funny that other people saw that, and that certainly is a note I find in many dunkels.  This however, is just flawed on many levels, showing very poor lagering time.  Mouthfeel is fizzy, then watery (apart from the syrupy sweetness).  Some light yeast dryness on the end, but its a last ditch effort and quite failed.  No alcohol apparency.  To the drain with you.

2473,"From a 12 oz. embossed green bottle with no bottled/freshness date.		Poured a hazy dull amber with a foamy head that settled into a thin lacing.		Aromas of metallic melts, light spices and sweet lemony.		Fizzy carbonation and a smooth without much crispness light bodied mouthfeel.		Bland, watery roasted and metallic malts, a watery spiciness, a light lemon flavor and a watery finish with a strange metallic flavor lingering in the palate that hurts the drinkability.		I didnt find this to be too pleasing and for a dunkel, pretty poor overall.

It poured a hazy reddish brown with a film of large bubbles in lieu of a head.  Theres a strong caramel and butterscoth aroma, and the flavor coming from a watery mouthful is mainly weak caramel.  Id try this again if I knew the bottle to be fresh.
",1
2478,"April 2004. Deep red copper lager with a sweet caramel aroma, and butterscotch. Watered down caramle and boiled corn in mouth. Still good malt character , and if it is was fresher, would make a great Eastern europe dark beer.

2479,"Head is initially small, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is hazy dark amber, bottle conditioned. Aroma is moderately malty (caramel, toasted grain/cereal), lightly hoppy (herbs), with light notes of licorice and sassafrass. Flavor is lightly sweet, moderately acidic. Finish is lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation. Ack!  The nose is ok, but it goes downhill from there, in the form of a bland and watery fluid.  Very likely far from fresh, but there arent any offensive oxidation notes.  In fact, the spice aromas are surprising, but may have sparked from the considerable yeast layer in the bottom of my sample. Interesting for the nose (and eye, being hazy), but thats it.

2511,"Bottle, thanks pivnizub. Probably the fullest commercial bottle I ever opened, there was beer to the brim. Cloudy brown, small UFOs, brown-white lacing head.  Banana, chrismas spice and bread aroma. Somewhat astringent on the palate, lemon, pumpernickel with banana, spices and some jelly. Meshes together on the third sip. Bready aftertaste. Solid dry mouthfeel, sparkly - overall quite easy to drink.

2512,"Hefig-frischer Antrunk, in dem das Malz zwar prsent ist, sich aber vorerst nicht in den Vordegrund stellt. Erst im Mittelteil etwas malziger, dennoch ist die Hefe weiter stark vorhanden. Das Malz breitet sich allerdings im hintergrund aus und wird etwas rstig, leicht kruterartig und schokoladig. Die Intensitt ist angenehm, fast ist der Weizenbock als sffig zu betiteln. Nun wird das Bier allerdings schwerer, auch die Hefigkeit scheint nun behbiger. Dunkel, angenehm hefig, kaum sprbar suerlich im Hintergrund. Das Bier bliebt nun auf diesem wrzigen Level, im Nachgeschmack ndert sich abgesehen von einer trockenen Ankndigung nichts. Der Bock gleitet langsam aus, absolut spitze ist der wrzige, noch lang haltende Nachgeschmack. Super Weizenbock! 9/12/12/13/11/12

2513,"Bottle looks really good as well as the beer in the glass. Dark, nice head. Yeasty-malty aroma. Starts strong, quite yeasty, fruity like orange. Finish more and more malty, a bit sourish, unbalanced. Not really drinkable. Not my favourite.

2514,"Bottle sampled at Papss on 8/30/09: Slightly hazy dark copper amber color with a large frothy white head.  Aroma of sweet malty wheat with a hint of caramel and clove with some banana yeasty esters.  Starts with pretty good fullness and sweet dark caramel and wheat along with a clove spice and banana fruitiness before a doughy semi-sweet finish.  A pretty true to style weizenbock with lots of clove character.

2515,"From Koelschtrinker via trade.  Poured a cloudy pale brown color with a nice off-white head and spotty lacing.  The aroma was tons of sweet malts, spicy cloves and some yeast.  The flavor was clove, malt and yeast with a touch of unchecked alcohol.  Thin mouthfeel.  Drinkable.  Not bad.

2521,"Cloudy dark tawny brown with thick head.  Rather meaty aroma with some graham crackerish notes, with a rusticity thats hard to pin down.  Sturdy alcohol.  Again a touch thin, fizzy with some crackery notes and a light yeast signature in the off-dry finish.

2522,"Bottle 50cl. @ home.Unclear hazy, sparkling, medium orange amber color with a large, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white to light beige head.

2523,"Draft at brewpub. Murky mahogany-brown with a thick tan head. Looks meaty. Smells meaty/gamey too. Some phenols, with earthy minerals in the nose too. In spite of the flaws, actually does not smell so bad. Has a great palate and the flavors are actually quite nice. Off-dry finish, and a higher ABV works by mellowing what could have been too many residual sugars. Its a pretty nourishing but strange brew.
",5
2524,"Cloudy brown body with a superb foamy beige head. Moderated aroma with some light spices like clove and vanilla, some banana and citrus. Smooth mouthfeel, banana and fruity taste with some spicy clove, nice lemony flavor. Minimal roasted characfter in the aftertaste, fine.

2526,"Bottled (BB 01/2005)	Hazy nut brown colour, floating yeast, good tanned and cloudy head. Crisp and sour banana and wheat aroma. Mouthfeel is sour with good-bodied wheat character and crisp citron and lemon flavors. Sourness makes this quite unique beer, also a bit hard to drink in quantities.

2528,"bertriebene Schaumkrone, ich brauchte 10 Minuten, um das Bier gnzlich ins Glas zu schtten. Mild malziger Antrunk ohne groen Tiefgang. Leicht herb werdend und bleibend, im Hintergrund scharf, etwas alkoholisch. Dennoch ist das Bier nur wenig aromatisch und kann das vorhandenen wrzige Potential nicht nutzen, einzig das Malz bildet zumindest eine solide Basis. Feinhefig zum Schluss, in der Intensitt weit unter dem Malz. Ein ungewhnlich mildes Bier. 13/8/7/7/8/7

2552,"Had all three of these werneckers at a little festival in orbendorf (hope Im spelling that right). This smells fine. The first flavor is of beer, but then the sprite soda flavor dominates the end. seems very much like a soda. Good, but why drag down their excellent pils by adding anything?

2588,"Huge white foams immediately climbs over the hazy deep golden pour. A rathe unsettling aroma follows where fresh herbs encounter slightly husky graininess and an obvious creamed vegetable profile that reaches its summit in canned corn nuances. Heavy hay and grasses circle this vegetal showcase.

2596,"Bottle.  Sour malt aroma - sort of similiar to a barnyard but indicatvie of the style.  Medium tan clear color.  Complex flavor - sour malt with hints of grass, hay and a mild hops finish.  Pretty much the best example of a Kellerbier you can get from a bottle.

2597,"The after its disemboguing from the 500ml brown bottle the beer sets in the glass a slightly bemused amber color with a dinosauric head that is creamy in texture and a toothsome light tan in color, the lace a thick and glutinous blanket to obfuscate the glass. Nose has a definite malt sweetness with a bit of lime like tartness, quite crisp and clean, the start is lightly sweet with a pleasant malt profile, the top id middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is stern in its acidity, the hops are strong in the balance with the malt profile, quite dry and long lasting aftertaste, a style I sample rarely, and this bottle brought back from Germany by a co-worker, fresh from the brewery.

Very clean beer, there is nothing present of the barnyard aroma you find in many Franconian beers. Very well brewed beer, could use a bit more power.

2616,"500 ml flip-top bottle in Germany. Everytime I see the Bavarians (even the Franks) trying to make a Pils, it is like the North Germans doing the same with a Hefe. Anyway was this a Pils or a Helles? It feels like a Helles but looks and acts like a Pils. It is kind of both in my mind. All the Danes that rated this already could care less and just reated it as a beer. Alcohol is too low for a Helles but it is too sweet for a Pils. Bad it was not.

This didnt leave much of a positive impression on me and in fact Im a little disappointed I drove >50 miles to find and ended up having to by an entire case of it just to try it.

Hope profile falls to the bitter side, with grapefruit and some pine. Malt is not very sweet or aromatic, being mostly rye toast and a touch of burnt caramel. I like my APAs to be lighter, more on the fruit, light toast and caramel side and very sessionable, so Im not a fan of this ale which is on the dark side and can be a bit of work. Still, its a solid ale from a promising craft brewer and many folks will appreciate it more than I do.

2865,"The pils is nicely malty with a bit of sweetness to accentuate it.  There is just enough diacetyl to be not unpleasant, along with a medium hop bitterness that balances nicely with the light malty sweetness.  There is also quite a bit of fruitiness to the pils, which seems a bit out of place in lager.  In talks with the owner I have found out the likely culprit of this ale like taste, apparently the lagering phase is only 10 days, and the diacetyl helps to confuse the matter.

Served on draught, has a nice hazy gold color to it.  Tastes a bit tart, with a  pleasing amount of carbonation.  The yeast flavor is good, not assertive and all the proper components for a Bavarian Weizen are present: clove, banana esters, yeastiness, and of course the refreshing wheat flavor.

2875,"The Zwickel is definitely this breweries best beer that is made on a regular basis.  A bit of hop flavor comes through that I have not been able to detect as much in their other beers.  There is not nearly as much diacetyl as the other beers, which really helps the overall flavor.  The diacetyl in fact is barely perceptible (I may even be imagining that I can taste it).  This beer has a slight haze to it and to my mouth is quite a bit rounder tasting than the corresponding pils.

2881,"The dunkel seems to use the same yeast (a standard house yeast which is taken from the Radeberger Brewery) as the pils.  The first time I was there it was a dark red color, which was a brilliant garnet when held up to a candle.  Again, it also displayed a malty sweetness with a bit of diacetyl, but without the assertive hop bitterness of the pils.  At other times it can be not quite as clear but the flavor is much the same if not just a bit sharper.

2888,"UPDATED: FEB 1, 2007 Bottled from Cruzat Beer House, Buenos Aires.  Upon opening it spray painted the roof, walls, bed and floor of my tiny hotel room, then it kept overflowing for ages. After Id finished cleaning the room itwas still overflowing. Upon pouring it came out opaque black with rich beige head. The aroma of green apples mixed with sugar hinted me that it was a very sweet beer, and this was confirmed upon first taste. Besided a little bit of chocolate the porter charcateristics are vague. Instead its a mild beer with rounded mouthfeel and low bitterness. Once it reached room temperature it improved, as the green apples in the nose were replaced by more chocolate.

2907,"This beer suffers greatly from being pushed into a popular style without the necessary features.  As an IPA, this brew is an underhopped bummer.  As a regular American Pale Ale, it fares much, much better.  Unfortunately, its been declared an IPA, so I have to rate it as such.  And the results are very average.  The flavor has a deep malt vein that runs underneath, which proves too much for the mild hops (mild, of course, being relative.)   The hops are apparent, piney with a hint of citrus, but the malts trounce any blossoming IPA-dom.  This beer would probably rate in the mid-3s as a APA.  As it is, blah.  So just ignore their signs and treat it as a regular Pale.

Nose was the expected hoppy citrus (grapefruit) but with a pronounced presence of malty earth scents. Mouthfeel was full and tingly, but again slightly offset by malty sweetness. The bittersweet hops and malts combinred for a pleasing taste, and the finish was long and enjoyable.

2919,"Not bad but not spectacular either.  I had the regular and the cask version, and the cask version was a definite improvement.  Its kind of toned down though.  I didnt get a lot of hops out of this, for it to be an IPA.  I did detect a pleasant vanilla character in this beer, especially in the cask one.  If this is the most aggressive brew in the house, then they need to hand out booster seats at the door.  A kiddie IPA for sure.

The description on the menu describes this as being an American style IPA, but I strongly disagree with that.

Nose was malt-centric (caramel and toffee) with less hoppage than expected (in the form of floral and faint citrus).  Earth and caramel base supported a rather weak hop effort (again the floral and citrus).  Medium-bodied and a tad sticky at times.  This was powerfully OK.

Aroma is malty and fruity, with a strong floral hop note. A medium bodied IPA. Malts are earthy and floral, touch of citrus at the front. As usual for a cask beer, it has a full, round and creamy mouthfeel. Touch of wood. Smooth taste. More in the English style of IPA, taste is more earthy and floral than hoppy. Good session IPA.

2943,"Nicely hazy red/chestnut brown.  Smooth, low carbonation palate, somewhat chewy, really graces the tongue like a velvet swipe.  Malty, light caramel, surprisingly dampened in flavor.  Easy to drink: dull, dry, dusty hops, doesnt have a ""big hop"" profile.  It struck me that this is an English IPA.  However, the funny thing is that the menu describes this beer as an ""American-style, single hop varietal with domestic Fuggles.""  Theres your contradiction: the Fuggles give it the character of an English IPA, even if theyre US-grown hops.  (on tap, Rock Bottom Atlanta)

2955,"Atlanta.  On tap at Rock Bottom Restaurant and Brewery in Buckhead.  I up my scores on this a bit to compensate for the fact that I already dont like IPAs.  Really, really bitter hops that are even stronger and more ""aggresive"" (to quote the commercial description) than the pale ale at this brewery or many other IPAs.  The only one Id say I disliked more was the Flying Dog IPA.  Both are not that fun to drink, unless you like that kind of beer.

2960,"The waitress brought it out in a pint glass from the tap.  The appearance was somewhat murky brownish amber with a thin head.  The aroma was hoppy and reminded me of fresh cut hay.  The taste was extremely dry and quite bitter.  There were hints of roasty graininess, citric tartness, and some sourness.  It was light and watery in its mouthfeel and did not taste like a beer suitable for an ocean voyage halfway around the world.  My overall impression was that this was a fresh crisp beer that lacked much complexity and backbone to justify the moniker of an IPA; this was more like a west coast pale ale with some generous dry hopping.

2962,"Atlanta: Loop IPA) Nice IPA, orange/bronze color with a creamy puffy head and lacing down the sides of the sampler. The aroma is very floral and citrusy, a tad musty if I might say though. The flavor was fairly well balanced and had a strong malt backbone. The finish was a little more astringent that what I usually find in an IPA, but it was well worth trying.

Maple nut fudge with a light cocoa powder accent the aroma, and the house linen factor is still omnipresent.  At least weve got more nutty intonations (mocha beans, hazelnut, etc.)  Loose and acidic flavor as expected, with a nut extract trait delusionally keeping it from being completely incohesive.  Citric character is void, and conspicuous by its absence.  Mild sting of compressed orange toffee and cedar sap, pricking most at the outset.

3029,"Judging by the high marks from everybody else, I thinking I might have gotten a bad batch at the Nashville location.  Nice red-tinged brown with a thin white head, and a good malty, nutty aroma.  Flavor was pretty good at first, when the glass was cold, but as it warmed, a bitter, completely unappealing strong yeastiness became apparent (This was the same flavor that has plagued some of my homebrews, in particular the batches that I brewed without using a secondary fementer, so the wort spent the entire fermentation on top of the spent yeast).  The initial flavor of this brown ale was quite nice, a smooth, lightly toasted sweet nuttiness, but all of that goodness suffered because of the off-flavors in this brew.  I plan on trying again and re-rating, but for now, I very unhappy.

I know a lot of people dont like theyre brown ales messed with (keep them simply and keep them good), but they tweeked this one just right where its different but still a good brew.

3034,"Poured a dark amber color with a grand fluffy head and excellent lacing. Spicy aroma that almost reminded me of lemongrass or cilantro. The mouthfeel seemed on the thin side, but the flavor was good-toasty sweet maltiness, chocolatey and with a vague sourness. Finished short with a light hoppy bitterness. Growler from the Nashville location.

3035,"UPDATED: JAN 16, 2007 Rerate Had at Disney this time around - more pronounced chocolate flavor Original 2.9 On tap at the Chattanooga location. Has a dark copper appearance with a light head.

Earlier Rating: 10/7/2003 Total Score: 3 Ratings combined 1/16/07 Had on tap at the brewpub in Jacksonville. Sports a light brown head with decent lacing. Light amber appearance - sparkles in the sunlight. The aroma has a bit of a sweet sugary essence to it. Has a bit of an artifical taste to it and not quite as sweet as a brown ale should be in my opinion. Smooth palate.

3039,"Tap, EPCOT, March '04.  Root beer colored beer, small but creamy head that faded quickly but lingered at edges and left a bit of lace.  Med-dark dried fruits on nose, golden raisins, sweet, not roasty or chocolatey.  Flavor of sweet, slightly roasted malts, coating palate but not cloying and sticky like some brown ales.  An average example of an uninteresting style, but not bad.

3040,"Atlanta (Sweet Magnolia): Dark tawny brown color with a creamy head and light lacing (standard for brewpub samplers here).

Cookie cutter indeed.

Doesn't really meet my criteria for an excellent brown ale, but I'm in Florida, the home of hot, humid Summers. This brew matches the climate nicely.

The manager paid for our samples and even bought us appetizers to help clear our palates.  This brew poured a small head of off-white colored foamy finely sized bubbles that left behind a semi-transparent brown colored uncarbonated body.  It had avery mild dark malt aroma and the mnouthfeel was initially smooth and slightly tingly while finishing with a lingering mild brown tingle.

3089,"Sweet Magnolia Brown Ale; the name alone intones lush visions of rich nuts, brown sugar, and maybe even just a touch of spice. Quite an accomplishment for a brown ale based just on her name. Fourth in my lineup of beers from Seven Bridges Grill & Brewery in Jacksonville, FL I hope she lives up to her name. A good brown ale is a pleasure all her own.		She comes to me a burnt copper with brown earthen tones where the light manages to shine through. A small head lingers on top, awaiting my eventual disturbance. Right away roasted malts and nuts (chestnuts), caramel, toffee, sweet raisins, chocolate, and cherries carry my senses away. A very promising start. Wasting no more time, I reach for my glass and savor the first quaff. A fuller body then some brown ales, she is replete with tons of bitter nuts right up front while chestnuts and bitter lemon esters follow-up. As I delve further into my glass, the lemon zest becomes more prominent, pushing some of the nuts to the background. Despite her fantastically varied nose, this is sadly about all that her body and palate come to. Not complex at all and unfortunately not able to live up to neither her name nor her nose, the Sweet Magnolia Brown Ale falls short.		Brown ales are great session beers. Full flavored with a rich body and highly quaffable, when I want a beer to enjoy a few of, brown ales are an easy choice. The Sweet Magnolia Brown Ale fails to live up to my expectations of a quality brown ale. She definitely had potential and I wouldnt drain-pour her, but there definitely could have been more complexity to her personality.

This one is earthy with a lightly sweet mouth-filling malty character balanced with just a touch of hops at the finish. Bordering on a brown porter, this brown makes a fantastically flavorful session beer that goes well with standard bar sandwich fare. It is also appealling to the eye with a dark brown body capped with a rocky resilient tan head. Solid lacing leaves a poignant reminder of how good a brown ale can be. 07/02/2009 - Had this on tap at Rock Bottom in Charlotte. Still one of the better browns Ive had.

3141,"Appearance: Pours a deep gold body with a disappointingly small, quickly diminishing, white head.		Smell: Pils malt aroma, a touch grainy, maybe even a touch corny with a pervasive background floral note.		Taste: Sweetish pale and pils malt taste, with a very fine hint of grain and corn. Floral hops with just a slight tingle of spice. Very restrained bitterness. Still finishes on the sweet side with a lingering floral taste.		Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied (but just barely!). Medium carbonation.		Drinkability: Fairly basic; not as rich or complex as some of its brethren, but it gets the job done.

Upon receiving my weizen glass and taking a whiff, I was relieved. Very strong esters are evident in the nose with assertive Euro hops. Clove, banana, wood, bread are all evident here. This is thirst quenching and juicy, yet not too light by any means. I was actually surprised at how evident the hop character was. Wooden tones are apparent throughout the flavor, giving a pleasant acidic edge to the juicy banana and clove thing. This was surprisingly well executed. This beer is most obviously a German styled hefeweizen. . .kind of reminds me of Victory Sunrise.

3231,"On tap at the Disney World Boark Walk location. Poured a medium and cloudy golden color. Aromas and tastes of wheat, cloves, citrus and bananas. Props to the bar tender to ask if I wanted a slice of lemon or not. It was in the upper 80s and this went down nicely...

3232,"Draft.  Another cloudy appearnce (due to being unfilltered)--which I liked that.  Aroma was a little fruity, not overwhelming though.  Not too bad of an American wheat brew.
",1
3233,"Cloudy unfiltered and capped with a small white spritzy head. Light banana in nose, but lacking and clove hefe character. A slight lemony tartness added to its thirst quenching ability. but overall a rather run-of-the-mill American wheat entry.

3236,"Tasted on tap at brewpub. Pours a very light gold color. Small sized white foamy head. Aroma is wheat and slightly sweet. Light to medium bodied American wheat.

3239,"On tap at Chattanooga location. A hazy pale color in the glass with a thin white head. Mainly clove in the aroma with wheat and hints of banana. The flavor found a nice mix of banana, clove, and orange. Light body. Left me look forward to more summer brew on the horizon.
",1
3240,"Had this on tap at BellSouth Park (home of the Lookouts)  :)  It smelled like swill, it looked like a pale nude color, and it had minimal foamy head.  The flavors were quite impressive, however, IMO.  Lots of that gumball wheat flavor I love, nice banana and clove, and malt character.  The flavor was almost chewable, but the palate was as thin as it looked.  A decent ballpark beer, and probably a decent summer brew, as its cool and refreshing with a good clean finish.
",1
3241,"Draught @ Brewpub (Disney):  This one pours a cloudy, weak straw yellow  color.  There wasnt much head on it.  The aroma has a whiff of clove and banana.  There was much less evidence of them in the taste.  Somewhat wheaty taste, but a thinner body and a bit weak.  My wife likes it.

3243,"Hazy straw yellow, white head.  Bananas in the aroma.  Fair amount of banana in the flavor, and not enough clove to balance.  Seemed a bit fruity for style and some hints of lemon.  I note its here in Ratebeer as an american wheat, tho the bartender told me its a german style hefe.

3244,"First (and only Big River) beer I had at the 6/2005 Nooga gathering.  Had a pleasant hazy straw color with a bubbly rough head.  I noted some Belgian style aromas including banana and spice (clove), though they were light.  The flavor had some citrus fruit at first sip (lemon) but it moves quickly to a fuller spicier fruit/banana cake flavor.  Certainly not light and quenching as I had imagined but good in its own way.  The body had a sticky feel that makes the flavors stick to your tongue.  Half way through I added a lemon wedge.  It lightened the body and magnified the citrus flavors (duh!).

3245,"Piss colored topped by a medium thick head with a good amount of lacing.  Its slightly sweet with nice clove notes, a little banana and a touch of yeast.  Light bodied, crisp and slightly tingly.

3246,"Tap.  Wheat aroma with banana and citrus hop notes, a little bit of cloves.  Pours cloudy yellow with a thin white head that hangs out around the rim; lined lacing.  Hoppy wheat flavor with a citrus rind finish.  Fizzy and crisp light bodied palate.

3248,"Basic and average, with your run of the mill sweaty musty aroma.  Full of acidic grapefuits and tangerines.  Some light banana, overall unimpressive.

3249,"Cloudy yellow appearance. Taste is bananas enough to satisfy any gorilla. Yeasty overtones. I'm not really into wheat beers but for the style this will suffice.

3250,"Pale cloudy yellow with a nice head, although it's not quite the stiff, long-lasting head you expect from a hefe. Clovey nose with slight banana esters. It has a nice wheaty body, nice but mild flavors. There's a faintly bitter finish from the high (for style) hopping.

3251,"Large frothy head is somewhat lasting and leaves cobweb-like lacing.  Hazy straw color with average carbonation appears average in body.  Nose consists of bananas, wheat, and flowery hops.  Heavy banana esters in the taste like many german wheats.  Very soft in the mouth and sweet throughout.  Slight acidity at the end.  Hops add a nice citrusy flavor to this beer.  Tart, dry finish.  Somewhat watery body.

3252,"Sampled Wowzer's Wheat at the brewpub at Walt Disney World's Boardwalk ... I assume that is the correct name of this listed beer.  Cloudy yellow in color, sturdy head.  Clove, banana, and tangerine aroma.  Big banana flavor...wow!  Finish, however, is a little weak. Still, very nice.

3257,"Part of a sampler: Pours a dark amber color with a medium off-white head. Thin lacing. This brew has a heady hops aroma which surprised me a little. There was also some malt which was not so much of a surprise. Medium bodied, and very hoppy for an amber which was a nice change of pace from what most Ambers seem to offer. There is also a nice finish that produces some hops and citrus on the tongue where previously there was none.

3266,"Tried on tap at the Florida Brew Fest 2011 addition. It pours deep copper  amber with thin mocha head. The aroma is a modest level of bitter pine hops, caramel malts and a bit of caramel kettlization caramel like candy. The taste starts off on the thin side but likely pretty good for a Pale Ale offering up caramel malts, crystal malts and modest levels of pine hop flavor and bitterness. The malts fade while the hops remain pretty consistent in strength right into the finish.

Sweet caramel and dark fruits on the flavors core with a decent dose of hops showing up (scratchy, rough pine and citrus primarily).. rough and bitter again on the finish.

3282,"On tap at the Seven Bridges brewpub in Jacksonville, FL and labelled as Seven Bridges American Red.  I had this beer with my lunch on the return trip from Disney, and oddly enough, this beers rating is almost eactly the same as the three beers I drank on the way down.  Anyway...arrived at the table a clear reddish amber with a moderate off-white head that faded to a ring at mid-glass and left a layer of foam with each sip.  Aroma of malt with a few notes of pine.  The flavor is malt up front followed by some pine and grapefruit.  If I were blindfolded, I would swear this was an east coast IPA and not a red ale.  Went well with my burger.

3283,"bottle. pours a crystalline red with a tall, long lasting off-white head. The aroma is sharp and astringent with hints of dough, caramel, berries, and chalk. This is pretty bitter stuff, but not in a good way. It cuts my palate with a chalky sting that fades to something like Twizzlers. On the upside some fruity and biscuity flavors make this quaffable, but I wouldnt right home to mom about it.

3284,"12 oz. bottle via trade with decaturstevo - Pours a clear reddish-amber color with a 1/2 finger thick off white head.  Very light lacing.  Aroma is toasted caramel malt and light citrus.

",5
3285,"12 oz. Copper-red with a four-finger head that settles into a lasting, creamy ring that leaves a sugary sheet of lace on the glass. Aroma is at first big and juicy toffee malt, then some citrus-pine resin. Flavor follows the pattern:Big rich caramel malt flavor on front is slowly overtaken by some surprisingly stout resin and citrus. Some toasted nut flavor shines through a bit also. Soft, medium body is smooth and dryish on the finish. This is the only bottled G-B brew Ive ever had, and is by far the best Ive had of their stuff; usually not too impressed by their brews.

Medium dry body.

3303,"Nashville.  Lord, help us.  Transparent, magnifying copper in color with the slightest accent of red.  First aromatic deviation of the night.  Sweet honeyed bread with a simcoe-esque bitter-sweet sensation.  Spicy toffee flavor might be a stretch, but the special effort is appreciated and noted.  Weak, hopped water.  Dammit.  Takes on a trait of werthers originals sitting in a dog water dish for a year plus.  Putrid copper pennies that made their way into the flower planter come through in the finish.

3304,"On tap at the Disney Boardwalk loction. Pours a medium to dark copper color - decent white head. Fresh, floral aroma with hints of citrus, perhaps a bit of malt in there.

That second sampler was much nicer, with a hugely smoother and creamier quality, and none of that metallic taste.

3327,"Tap, EPCOT, 3/04.  Cloudy amber/red with foamy head that lasted nicely.  Good looking beer.  Strong cascade aromas, mild, but pungent.  Nice malt front and hop back that balances well.  Melons and underripe pears, caramel.  Yum!  Crisp, smooth, slightly astringent finish, too.

3328,"UPDATED: SEP 15, 2007 Draft... Rating #1100... Crystal clear and as deeply copper as a freshly minted penny. Small, creamy, off-white head with terrific lacing and great retention.	The nose is malty and hoppy with notes of broth, horse blanket, straw and jalapeno pepper. Some floral hops as well.	Carefully bittered flavor with notes of grapefruit rind and alcohol. Medium-bodied with an oily mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Lengthy, bitter finish. Quite good!

3329,"Big River-Boardwalk-Epcot Center. This beer had a medium sized tan head that contained fine sized bubbles that quickly and completely dissipated. The nose was lightly malty and moderately hoppy with a bitter and hoppy flavor that had an aftertaste. The mouthfeel was smooth and bitter and this was a medium bodied beer with fair lacing.

3330,"TheDM and Hotstuff vacation brew 75.  This draft brew was sampled at the brewery on the Boardwalk at Disneys Epcot Center attraction near Orlando Florida.  This brew poured a large head of foamy finely sized light brown colored long lasting bibbles that left behind a poor lace and atransparent light brown colored uncarbonated body.  The aroma was that of a simple malt hop one and the mouthfeel was initially smooth with a malt hop biting finish.  The flavor contained notes of mild caramel malt and hops.

3337,"Malty with a caramel flavor and not much hops to speak about. Light orange color, seems english style and in my opinion it could definitely stand to have the hops kicked up about four notches.

3339,"Draft at Downtown Chattanooga location		The winner of the 8 different ones I had, this was the one I could have drank all day.

The aroma picked up candy-like sweetness with lighter fruits and grapefruit represented.. not too good, but somewhat intriguing.. seemed stronger than it actually was.  The flavor found sweet grapefruit and lighter other fruits accented by pine and grapefruit bitterness on the edges.. a bit sharp at times, and not very well-balanced.  Grainy and very sweet on the palate.. moderate carbonation left some sharper boozy notes on the finish.

Its just not worth the hassle to try and sort it out on Ratebeer sometimes.  So I sticking it in here anyway.  They just called it an American Pale ale without any cutsey name.  The bartender said it was between 5.25 and 5.5 abv.  And the beer was damn good.  Had a good hoppy APA aroma, and a really nice APA flavor.  Good malty body to go with the hops and a mildly bitter finish.

3367,"Light amber colour with a thin white head. Hoppy aroma fairly nice. Medium-bodied; Silky mouthful. Bright citrusey hop taste. Avertaste clean and hoppy. Overall, better than the average APA.

I read the name and didn't realize that the Imperial was part of the name of the beer and not the name of the style so I was expecting a big hoppy IPA.

Creamy, toasted, earthy flavor with sweet and metallic notes.  Creamy medium mouth feel that is fairly wet.  This is very much English styled pale ale.
",1
3376,"Draught.  Pours nut brown, caramel with orange hints and a small frothy light tan head that leaves some lined spotty lacing.  Smoky toasted oat malt, kind of ashy, with some fruit hop notes (berries).  Smoky burnt ash starts to hide the  toasted oat but the smokiness comes through with a hint of bacon and a moderately acidic hop character.  It seems watery.  Medium bodied and crisp, clean palate.  A very noble attempt by the brewer but I think the ash flavor kills it; still an interesting attempt.
",5
3377,"Draught:   The color is a clear copper-amber hue.  There was a little head, that dissapated quickly.  Little lacing.  The aroma had a bit of pine and grapefruit hoppiness to it.  The taste was somewhat bitter.  It had a strong, but medium bodied malt backbone, but no overall sweetness.  The oats have made the overall beer quite smooth and drinkable.  A good beer!

Smell: The nose is reasonably diverse, though nothing about it is particularly bold, as it presents only modest notes of coffee, charred bread crusts, chocolate, and caramel.		Taste: Unsweetened chocolate powder with a slackened taste of roasted grains followed by a charge of espresso flavor and buttery caramel. Slender hint of dark fruitiness. Minor, predominately roasty bitterness. Light chocolate and coffee tones on the finish.		Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied (just barely). Medium carbonation (again, just barely).		Drinkability: Not so bad, but, by no means is it the best. Still, its worth signing up for a pint when stopping by the Chattanooga location.

3385,"One of my first coffee stouts. And its actually made with espresso, not coffee, from a local coffee shop in Chattanooga. Looks black with just a little bit of light shining through, not completely opaque. Smell is of roasted espresso(coffee) and chocolate, hops are barely detectable. Taste has a lot of espresso in the front of it with chocolate and malty goodness going on. Really good taste. Lots of roasted qualities. Moutfeel is definitely thin for this, especially for a stout, but its not weightless, just needs some more body. Even though the mouthfeel is lacking, I drank about 6 of these in a night and could have had more. I love coffee stouts. So if you dont like coffee or espresso, stay away, but otherwise, this a good choice.

3386,"Growler sample: Pours a barely transparent dark mahogany brown with a thin light-tan head.  Fresh piney hoppy aroma has good chocolate and roasty presence with a touch of coffee.  Starts with a thinner, lightly sweet palate with a watery mildly roasted finish.  Could use a little more body, but otherwise a nice sweet stout.
",5
3387,"Draught at 11th Southern Brewers Festival in Chattanooga.  Pours black with caramel brown hints at the extreme edges of the beer where light begs to pass through.  Dark roasted coffee bean aroma hits you like a freshly roasted cup of coffee and then some sweet caramel malt notes pass by your nose long enough to doubt that coffee is the only ingredient.  Carbonated coffee flavor is well balanced with a caramel to toffee flavor and very low acidity.  Dark and thin, almost watery palate, silky smooth.
",5
3388,"Draft sample at the Southern Brewers Festival (9/05).  It actually took me a while to find this brew in the data base.  I almost reentered it under another name.  At any rate, this beer is supposedly brewed with coffee from the Stone Cup Roasting Company.  Pours a dark brown with minimal head, clear.  The aroma is nutty, malty, and heavy on the coffee/espresso notes.  The flavor is (duh) coffee!  Quite heavy on the coffee actually.  There is also what I will describe as a toffee-ish character but mostly a roasted malt presence and a light sweetness.  The body is light-medium but crisp, just like you might describe an iced coffee.  Really not a bad brew, but I found my self thinking that I could not drink too much of it.
",5
3389,"Recommended by Shag and Cheri I was anxious to try this one. This is great! It tastes just like an espresso. I can tell there is some chocolate in there as well. What a concept! Too bad this is only for a limited time.

3390,"Had on tap at the Chattanooga location - served as the nightcap to a fun evening with Shag and Cheri and my pick for a pint out of the sampler I had. Dark black appearance with a decent mocha head. Has a hard to describe,""creamy"" aroma. Has some coffee notes - yes, leans toward espresso.  Also has some chocolate and some creamy milkiness. Bitterness in the back end rounds it out nicely. Very good brewpub stout - according to the waiter - it is brewed with beans from a local coffee company.
",1
3391,"I was impressed with this stout...though it is a bit thin, it has a wonderful aroma and taste of fresh coffee that I believe distinguishes itself from other run-of-the-mill stouts.  I definitely want more of this!
",5
3392,"What an interesting beer! The aroma is of freshly brewed espresso. Apperance is dark with a small head. The flavor is espresso and roasted malt. Overall its not a very complex beer but it has a very good taste. I recommend it.
",5
3393,"This is really more of a coffee porter than a coffee stout. It's not quite opaque but dark brown enough to look black at a casual glance. It has a nice light tan head. The flavor is nicely roasty with little to no chocolate or sweetness. There is a nice lingering coffee bitterness in finish. The coffee actually improves what is normally a fairly thin stout (it's based on the Big River Iron Horse Stout), but the coffee flavor is mild and seems to have used a more common morning coffee bean instead of a more flavor espresso bean.
",5
3394,"Yellow, whitish head.  Aroma is a sourish pale malt dominated by lemon.  Taste is more unpleasant sourish malt.  Then a lemony finish.
",1
3395,"Aroma of lemon with no malt to speak of. A light yellow pour with a tiny white head and lace. Not much past the lemon. Very thin and watery but when cold pretty damn refreshing at a ball game when its 90 degrees.
",1
3396,"Draught in Chattanooga:  This one pours a very pale golden color.  It had a large white head, and left no lacing.  The aroma is lighter.  It has notes of lemon, very weak malts and some corn.  The taste is OK.  It is definitely light.  There are hints of the lemon, slightly light malt body, as well as some corn adjucts.  A good lawnmower beer.
",1
3397,"On tap. This is a really light gold beer. Aroma is corny, papery. . .pretty straight up pale lager territory. This is clean and very light on the palate. The most notable flavor is of some papery hops going on. A weak malty profile is here. Lemon quality is not very strong. Pretty boring beer.
",1
3398,"Not being a fan of lemons, I really tried hard to enjoy this but just could not. This is a pale lager with a little malt character that is just ruined by a heavy dose of lemons that bring to mind Lysol rather than sunshine. I staying far away.
",1
3399,"Draft in Chattanooga w/ Shag/Clash. Pours pale yellow with about zero head and lacing. Aroma was corona-off in a way, some lemony citrus. The flavor was drinkable, but only as a beverage, not as a beer. Sweetened lemon juice blended with a cheap pale lager recipe? I not sure how they made it, but it was thin, water, and too lemony. Not a good finale, Matt, but it was fun.

Taste: Light caramel maltiness with a touch of burnt biscuit crusts. Small sip of plum and cranberry fruit juices. Floral, citrusy hops with a medium bitterness. The beer finishes with a growing, lingering grainy tannic taste. Oh, who am I kidding, its astringent.		Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.		Drinkability: No thanks! The accumulating astringency greatly detracts from this being as easy-drinking as Id like.

3405,"Bottle, picked up in Chattanooga.  Poured clear reddish-caramel with a medium cap of beige head.  The aroma picked up sweet candied caramel and darker fruits with dusty floral accents.. sweeter overall and quite nice.

Lighter-bodied on the palate and quite bitter with an artificial aire to the sweetness.. felt OK.
",1
3406,"Sampler at the Nashville location - Poured a reddish amber in color with no head or carbonation.  Aroma was of slightly sour malts and very little hops.  Flavor was medium malty with some hop bitterness, but not enough to provide balance for the malt.  Some bitterness on the finish.  The sour aftertaste is a major distraction.

3407,"(On tap) Nashville. Clear, fully golden with a creamy, off-white head. Rather weak aroma of malt. Light-bodied with some caramel malt and a somewhat irritating bitter hopping which is utterly raw and unsophisticated. Vaguely moldy. 290306

3410,"Isnt a huge amount of malt and tastes a bit musty and peat-ish.  Has a strange transition from the initial flavor to the finish, from an earthiness to a sudden bitter kick.
",1
3411,"Draught at the Hamilton Place location. Pours deep clear amber with khaki head. The aroma is light caramel and toast with some distant cinnamon and perhaps nutmeg, maybe some vanilla, and some faint raisin. The flavor is toasted and Munich malt, and sort of a dusty caramel sweetness. It finishes with wood, herbal notes, and a slight drying spiciness. Yeasty aftertaste.
",1
3412,"Very malty and boring. Drank a number of these before a concert in September October. Not a whole lot going on and felt a bit heavy. Still it wasnt all bad. And it is an Oktoberfest. Cant expect a whole lot.

3413,"Bomber from Greenlife Chattanooga. Pours a hazy deep copper with an off white head. The aroma is vegetal with some hints at corn but has a good leafy and wooden quality. Its a typical Oktoberfest in flavor as well and it is pretty clean. Notes of leaves, toffee and some corn are present. Its not too sweet or overly metallic or vegetal. Pretty decent take on the style.
",1
3414,"Had on tap at the brewpub. Has a nice copper colored appearance, off-white head with a little bit of lacing. The aroma has a twinge of caramel to it. Solid malty flavor with a bit of candy-like sweetness to it. Turns a tad bit artificial on the back end though.

3416,"On draugh at Seven Bridges Jacksonville- 1L.  Pours dark copper with a nice head that lingers.  Bright clarity.  Aroma is nutty, toast and cracker like.  Taste is nutty as well with Munich malt shining through, low to no hop flavor.  Body is medium light with a medium dry finish.  A very clean beer.  It would be really good if the body was a bit fuller and there was a little more alcohol warmth.  A little out of style.

3421,"Draft at Chattanooga location. Amber in the glass with a creamy white head that slowly settled and left light lacing. The aroma was of light malts. The flavor found spices and caramel. Light body, watery, and tingly carbonation.
",1
3422,"A dark almost mahogany pour this beer really looks good. I only picked up malt on the aroma, I expected spices but nothing was there. A sweet malty flavor. A clean bitter finish. It was a tad over carbonated or fizzy for my taste. A good beer but just not as spicy as I expected.
",1
3423,"Tap (Big River - Nashville).  Pours a nice amber/coppery color.  Trace amount of head.  Aroma is mostly malts, with some citrus and yeastiness.  Flavor is mostly the same.  Medium body.  Average mouthfeel.  Very drinkable.  Would try again, but would not search it out.

3424,"UPDATED: APR 24, 2007 Pint at the Seven Bridges Brewpub in Jacksonville, a big party for the arrival of the Oktoberfest with some of the proceeds going to charity. This years brew was excellent.  Pours clear dark amber, with a nice big white head that slowly diminishes. Light aroma of sweet malt.  Flavor has caramel and malt and a slight sharp bite from the alcohol and carbonation and hops.  Very well balanced and drinkable.  A solid session brew.

3425,"Draft at brewpub. Poured a brown color with an average frothy off-white head that diminished slowly. with fair lacing. Good roasted malt and sweet aroma. Medium body. Good well balanced flavor of malt and a bitter sweet finish. Good brew.

3426,"Draught in Chattanooga.  Pours mahagony-copper with a medium frothy tan head and some decent lacing as well.  Malt (grain, straw, hay) and yeast (sweat) aroma with light roasted caramel malt and corn notes.  Malt adjucnt flavor with a bitter acidic yeast and nutty body.  Medium bodied and dry palate, refreshing.

3427,"Nashville.  Hoppy.  Faint honey taste with a lingering metallic aftertaste that Ive noticed on every one of their beers.
",1
3428,"On tap in Nashville.  Cloudy orange color.  It had a sour citrusy and mildly orange flavor that was somewhat gritty.  There was a lingering metallic aftertaste.
",1
3429,"Atlanta. On tap at Rock Bottom Restaurant and Brewery in Buckhead.  Brewed by Big River Breweries, centered in Chattanooga.  Well, this sure is a pretty good marzen.  While, it doesnt compare to Spaten and Sam Adams, I would probably name this as my third favorite marzen, which are some of my favorite bees.  It tastes a bit watery in comparison to those two and not quite as complex.  Hints of caramel and malt make it nice as we round out the Oktoberfest season.  Seems to be a typical marzen, really, not much special.
",5
3430,"Burnt orange with an ample tan head and big malty nose, this Oktoberfest is medium bodied and flavorful, but somewhat unrefined. A bit of harshness in the finish makes this one less than perfect. Quite hoppy for the style as well. A good brew, but could use improvement.
",5
3431,"Orange color with a dense off-white head. Slight maltiness, some of spice in the aroma. Medium-bodied; Malt character in the taste and not much else. Aftertate with some spicyness, but pretty subtle. As far as a Marzen goes not my favorate but I'd order again.
",5
3432,"Light medium body, nothing special, malty fizzing, hops a bit oxidized, still not much true character, too effervescent
",1
3433,"I've been impressed with Big River beers so far and this is no exception. Granted this beer is not as good as Spaten or Paulaner Oktoberfests but it's still quite good. Dark amber appearance. Flavor is a little carbonated with a heavy malt profile and a slight bitterness. Faint fruit flavors are present. Another good brew from Big River although I do prefer many of thier others to this style.
",5
3434,"Had on tap at the brewpub. Has a nice copper colored appearance, off-white head with a little bit of lacing. The aroma has a twinge of caramel to it. Solid malty flavor with a bit of candy-like sweetness to it. Turns a tad bit artificial on the back end though. Decent brewpub fare.

3435,"Nice, nutty, lightly sweet aroma.  Cherrywood orangey beer.  Dry, nutty, very lightly sweet, medium hopping. Good with food. Fairly quick finish with mild astringency.

3436,"Amber pour with a slight head. Some spices and malt in the aroma. Kind of bland taste. Nothing real great.

3437,"Orange/amber colour with a dense off-white head. Small maltiness, a bit of spice in the aroma. Medium-bodied; Malt character in the taste and not much else. Aftertate shows a bit of some spiceyness, but that too is fairly subtle. Not a good Marzen...below average for the style. I had this on draught at Big River (owned by Gordon Biercsh) in Chattanooga, Tennesse on 26-September-2003.

3438,"Draft. Pours amber with a white head. Lightly sweet malty aroma, but relatively clean and grainy. The flavor is malty, with sweet and grainy notes, and not much else. Pretty good.
",1
3439,"Draught at the Hamilton Place location. Pours light copper with sticky off-white head. The aroma is very mild with toasted malt, a tangerine hint, and subtle fruity hops. The flavor is very mellow with toasted malt, a hint of caramel, a little bit of wood. Theres a sweetness that somehow reminds me of the marshmallows in Lucky Charms cereal. Light fruity hops in the finish. The caramel quality sticks around through the aftertaste. It seems to get fruitier after several sips.

3440,"Silky smooth hops. Good spice to balance. Good overall just not my style. Ok brew.

I know it has won some awards so my review is just that  my opinion.  I dont find a very clean finish  sometimes grassy or herbal that leaves a funky taste with me.

3460,"Bottle, picked up in Chattanooga.  Poured clear, lighter reddish-orange with a short-lived cap of white head.  The aroma picked up lots of over-sweetened caramel malts with the slightest bit of toast to em.. fainter dark fruits emerge with warmth, along with some herbal and earthy notes.  The flavor again found too-sweet caramel and dark fruits with fizzy herbal and floral bitterness falling off the sides of the tongue.. sweet, tacky finish.  Lighter-bodied and too sweet on the palate, but refreshing.. this was certainly drinkable.

A good beer.

Nothing very special about this beer, but I did think it was one of their better styles (I a pale ale drinker and I did not like their pale ale attempts).

3482,"Draft-Big River Brewery-Chattanooga, TN. This beer had a small sized white head that contained fine sized bubbles that was mostly lasting. The body was uncarbonated and transparent with an orange hue. It had a malty nose and a bitter and hoppy flavor to it. The mouthfeel was bitter and fairly smooth. This was a light-medium bodied beer that was just so-so.

3486,"This is a blah beer. It has a nice amber, glowing color but lacks a lasting head. There is no aroma and has less flavor than their light lager. It's just bland. There is a bit of caramel and maybe a little wood. Quite smooth, but I've had better Viennas.

3487,"UPDATED: AUG 16, 2003 A good beer especially for something found at a minor league baseball game. Appearance is orangish. Aroma is malty and fruity.

3490,"UPDATED: MAY 4, 2005 Draught in Chattanooga:  I agree with most of the other reviews.  This one pours a slightly orangish-amber color.  Somewhat floral aroma.  This beer has a nice malty balance with the hops.  There is a decent tart, citric taste from the hops without being overpowering.  A smooth, tasty lager, but nothing too special.

3496,"A one day old growler. The whole growler. Pours dark copper with a frothy, though quickly disappearing white head. The aroma is fairly hoppy, but only in the way of Euro hops. Wood, hay, and an interesting fruity character are noted. The mouthfeel is medium. This is pretty crisp, but not overly vegetal or doughy like a lager may be. The fruit notes are more like berries and less like apples. Hops are approachable but assertive, given the style. This is a basic beer that reminds me of the cheap crap in cans at the grocery store, but without any of the flaws. This is smooth, clean, and very drinkable without any surprises or super deep complexity.

",5
3501,"Dark orange appearance with a moderate head. The aroma was faint malt and candy. Flavor was malty and a little on the light side. This favored a lager more than an ale. The aftertaste was slightly bitter. Although I have to admit I had a hard time concentrating on the flavor with all the people looking down at me from the elevated walkway directly above my head. Overall a refreshing beer for the summer months but nothing outstanding. Perhaps we will see this one at the upcoming Georgia Beer Festival??

3505,"UPDATED: APR 29, 2008 on draught. Pours an opaque black with a picturesque, frothy tan head. Theres a fair amount of roasted aroma over the musty barley and a bit of sweet cream. The palate is silky but thick, and the flavor has ample truck-stop coffee and a thinner cream sweetness. The semi-dry dark chocolate finish pulls this stout together. Its slightly thinner than Id like for a stout to be and has a borderline English porter feel. 			[April 27, 2008]		From a growler: This is a really good looking beer. Its near black and has a creamy, even, long lasting dark tan head. The aroma is inviting with plenty of oats, chocolate, and an almost smoky bittersweetness. Palate on this one is nice and creamy with very low carbonation. I get hearty chocolate, medium roasted coffee, a bit of oats, and a nicely sharp finish. This is pretty enjoyable. I had no problem finishing the growler.

3524,"Tap, EPCOT, 3/04.  The tail end of service for this special beer, according to the server.  Looks more schwarzy than stout-like on the pour--not much head, pretty black, but thin looking.  Aromas of light roast coffee, light slightly burnt diner coffee, and bakers chocolate.  Light texture is spot on, little carbonation present, thin body on finish.  Roasted malt presence is pleasing with a bit of a surprising hop bitter back end.  Not bad stuff.

3525,"UPDATED: APR 18, 2004 Chattanooga Big River location.  Pours thin, black and uncarbonated. Nutty smell, with some dry spice (cumin?) also present in the nose. Iron Horse has a coffee flavor, with a dry and smoked finish. This may sound appealing to many, but this profile too far from my preference for a sweet stout for this to be a personal favorite.

3526,"Atlanta (Iron Horse): Dark black color, CO2 pour, light head and no lacing. Roasty aroma, very creamy, not too sweet. Light columbian coffee and chocolate (dark I think). Flavor is vague at best, pretty flavorless. Finishes dry and bitter but smooth. Eh.

This brew poured a small head of finely sized mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a good lace and an opaque black body with no visible carbonation.  It had a dark malt and coffee aroma.  The mouthfeel was initially smooth then finished with a slight hop bite.  It was an OK brew, but not a great one.

Good lacing with a mocha-colored head on top of a charcoal black pour. Sweet chocolatey aroma. Solid coffee stout flavor without the chalkiness and a bit of chocolate undertones to round it off. Perfect level of acidity - melts in your mouth. Earlier Rating: 5/26/2003 Total Score: 3.5 (Combined on 1/16/07)  Had at their Chattanooga location.  Jet black appearance, nice, decent sized mocha colored head. Had a bit of a smoky aroma to it.

3536,"The body is nicely black with a good lasting head. The aroma and flavor are BIG chocolate supported by charcoal and roasted malt. This isn't harsh, but soft, the bitterness of both the dark malts and the hops are very low. A bit sweet, but not cloying. This is a good easy-drinking stout.

This is the best of the Big River Brews - should be their Flagship Brand.  Very nice.

3552,"I hate to say Im surprised by the quality of this stout, since Ive no qualms with Big River, but I am.  Heres why:  over a decade ago, my friends and I would regularly visit Chattanooga, and would inevitable end up getting snockered at Big River off their house beer.  However, over the past few years as Ive become a horrendously unapologetic beer snob, Ive learned that pretty much everything I drank in my college years was utter crap.  So Im very, very pleased that Big Rivers Iron Horse Stout is so damn tasty after such a long interval between trips to this restaurant/brewery.  Sufficiently bitter and roasty with a smooth, chocolatey middle, this beer never gets mired in the metallic fruitiness that plagues so many smaller American stouts.  Plus, you get rich stout flavor without a daunting ABV, which is always welcome.  And I have no clue when it comes to beer-and-food pairings, but this stout was pretty good alongside my meatloaf.

3553,"Deep amber hue, nearly black, and with a dark, tanned head. Warm, nutty, malted roasty aroma. The body is candi-malted with sweet burnt caramel, and bubblegum chewy perforations. Decent, but atypical for a stout.

3554,"Im not a big fan of Big River or their beers. Its not that they are bad. Its just that Ive never had a particularly good beer or meal there. The Ironhorse Stout is probably my favorite beer so far at Big River. Very drinkable and maybe even too light. This guy is smooth and actually fun to drink. Typical stout coffee and roast notes. Not as much fruit as some, but unique enough at least by Big River standards. I dig it.

3575,"A stout is beautiful. Dark, seductive, sensual, as soft as a velveteen sky and as complex as the cosmos it blankets within. There are those who are afraid of the dark beers, but I say nay, there is nothing to fear but fear itself. Well, that and a bad beer; that is beyond scary at times. When my beer line-up was brought before me, the two beers my eyes and my tastebuds gravitated to immediately were the stout and the special brew, Belgian-style golden ale. I am saving the special brew for last, so instead I am faced with my dark beauty, the Iron Horse Stout.		An abyssal black-brown, there can be seen very little discernable light struggling through her depths. A thick khaki head fades to happy scattered puffs while lace decorates the sides of my glass. Right away my nose is greeted by espresso, bakers and dark chocolate, hints of cream, and lemon rind. Well played. I wait for no-one when it comes to my stouts, supping greedily upon her dark brew. Her body and mouthfeel is surprisingly thin with hints of lemon in her dry finish. Light notes of cream remind me of skim milk while chocolates, espresso, and sweet raisins play with my tastebuds. Her finish continues to dry my mouth with lingering esters of bakers chocolate and lemon. Simple and clean, the palate is there but the mouthfeel is a bit on the weak side which detracts somewhat from my enjoyment of the Iron Horse Stout.		Overall, she is not a bad stout. The Iron Horse Stout from Seven Bridges would be a great starter stout for those who wish to dabble in the dark brews without being scared away. She lacks the oomph, but has the spirit.

The aroma is slightly roasty with some char and bitter chocolate, and the cask version sports a bit of woody sweetness.

3585,"On tap at the Stogie and Stout event, 2008 edition.	Pours pretty darn dark with nice half inch to three quarter inch firm mocha head and spotty lacing. Looks like a nice beer. The aroma is fairly strong with roasty malts mixed with toffee followed by burnt malts. Very pleasing combination. The taste is bold like the aroma with roasty malts and toffee followed by burnt malts to midway. The beer sort of trails off and becomes a bit thin as the finish approaches. In the after taste a nice roasty and toffee maltiness lingers.

3589,"Draught at Rock Bottom - Atlanta.  Aroma is intensely roasted malt and some coffee but a nice background of herbal hops.  Pours a deep opaque blackish-mahogany with 1-2 fingers worth of thick creamy crown, good retention and fingery lacing.  Flavour is full of roasted and cholocate tones, slight coffee, and a nice prominent hop bitterness.  Finish is extremely smooth leaving a great roasty aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is creamy with the perfect amount of moderate carbonation.  Overall a wonderful stout, although nothing too characteristic - too bad this is only at the restaurant.

Sweet Toll house chocolate chips come through in the flavor, along with chocolate covered mocha beans.  Scaled carbonation and chocolate milk tendencies help to keep this one heads and shoulders above the rest of this brewerys offerings.

The mouthfeel is medium with a semi-tart flavor of wax chocolate, brownie crust, and nuttiness. This is a fair winter beer but not as suited for the season as their Iron Horse Stout. This is drinkable. For a bock, I liked it well enough as it lacked that weird fruity, gummy flavor I sometimes find in the style.

The first half of the glass was drinkable, probably the best of the four I did at BR Chattanooga (although not lager crisp, even had some fruity ester notes over top of it), but with warmer temperatures, I couldnt get past the adjunct flavor in each sip.

3706,"During the five-plus years that I lived in Jacksonville, FL I only visited the Seven Bridges Brewpub once. I had one beer and I dont even remember what it was so I have no way of knowing if they even brew it any more. Of course, I wasnt anywhere near the beer geek that I am now, so what purpose would it have served me then to go and taste beers when such a thing wasnt any part of my reality. Now is a totally different story though, and during my most recent trip to Jacksonville a few weeks ago, I made sure to make it to Seven Bridges and take a flight through their beers, tasting-pad in hand.By now we should all be well aware of my critical lager palate and unfortunate disdain for bad lagers. Ive had a few good lagers of various styles in the last couple years, but have yet to have any enjoyable light lager experience. So what should my first beer during my Seven Bridges flight be but their Southern Flyer Light Lager. Raising my tasting glass, I prepare to begin my journey of, ultimately, six different beers.My Southern Flyer was appropriately a very light dried hay color. There is absolutely no discernable head before and after a couple small swirls to stir things up a bit while at the same time releasing her trapped nose. Surprisingly, her nose is replete with lemon zest and fresh grassy hops. This could actually be a good portend of things to come. My first quaff is clean, crisp, and bright with lemon and summer grass which fades into a sweet toasted malt finish. Adding yet another dimension to this light lager is the addition of a light chewy mouthfeel reminiscent of chewing on a piece of hay or straw. Soft and delicate, cereal grains add a solid and lightly sweet backdrop to Southern Flyers prominent citric lemon and grassy palate. As far as sample glasses go, she was over almost as soon as she began, but I was pleasantly pleased with the Southern Flyer Light Lager. A clean finish with lingering faint grassy esters concludes my very first good light lager experience.I must say, this light lager had a more balanced body and colorful palate then some standard lagers I have tried. One thing about lagers and lighter beers is that it is nigh impossible to hide any mistake no matter how small. I would have to say that Seven Bridges has with their Southern Flyer the quintessential light lager which many only dream of accomplishing. A brew well done.

Herbal baguette flavor at its best, but its fairly retched.  Wishy washy, yeasty lemons, and an overall light load.  Seems all too common with a Miller Lite, but only unpasteurized and sweetened with a touch of lemon juice in this rendition.  Corn flakes come out with a well-water finish to deliver on the ol formula of what-you-se-is-what-you-get.

Big caramel, with lesser notes of nuts, toast and a hint of earthy wood. Sticky caramel surfaced here and there. Hops were lightly grassy and a little herbal. Dryish finish wrestles with the cloying sweetness. Sweetness got a little heavy at times, but it wasnt too bad. I wouldve liked to see less sweetness or more bitterness, or both, but it was surely drinkable. RERATE Can: Somewhat meaty Irish red ale with a light carbonation. Hints of dark toast, toffee and bitter chocolate. Zingy hops give it an earthy, plant-like quality. Something in the sweet malts made me think of the candy coating on Boston Baked Beans.

3914,"A vigorous pour from the can into my Lost Abbey Teku glass produces a two-finger thick, amber tinged, tan colored head.  The beer is a dark amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, copper-amber hue when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of citrusy Cascade like-hops backed up by sweet-tea like crystal malt.  The hop character is definitely dominant and has a touch of resinous character to it, but it really reminds me of ruby-red grapefruit juice and zest more than anything.		Fairly sweet tasting up front, with softer hop character than was in the aroma, but the finish takes a wrong turn some where and reminds me of stewed, oxidized crystal malt in a not so pleasant way; my second sip has this morphing into a dirty dish water like flavor that is backed by a piney, bitter hop note.  At the front of the tongue the hop character contributes a citrusy, grapefruit like and orange zest flavor along with some resinous pine and herbal hop notes.  The beer has a pretty good texture for this type of beer; if it wasnt for the off flavor in the finish, this would be quite quaffable with its medium light body.		Certainly an interesting beer, at times the dirty flavors towards the finish seem to disappear (but mostly it is way to distracting), but I cant say that I really like the heavier crystal malt direction.  In the end though the flavor can almost seems gross; it really does remind me of dirty dishwater, it is a shame as there might be a half-way decent beer here otherwise.

The flavor offered some moderate hop bitterness, but was a very light presentation of the aroma notes, in a light body, and low carbonation, with most of the effervescence wasted in the pour and head.

Juicy hops, and a surprisingly large amount of them. They carried with them notes of sweet grass, aromatic flowers, and a little citrus (mostly orange). Finish was moderately bitter, but it seemed to be much more bitter in the aftertaste. At any rate, it gave the beer a little edge. Malts occasionally shot off mild notes of chocolate and bread dough. Not a bad beer at all. Actually, it was pretty good. You have no idea how excited I was to find a brewery in one of my favorite little mountain towns ... and the fact that they werent catering specifically to the light-lager-swilling tourists that drift through town (yeah, yeah, I was a tourist, too) made me even happier.

3936,"At the 2007 Big Beer, Belgians, & Barleywines Festival in Vail. I think that its odd that the brewer insists that this beer is a stout because it behaves much more like a barleywine. I suppose well just think of it as a hybrid. This does look like a stout- it is pitch black with a dark brown head. Fairly good sized head that hangs out atop the beer for a while. Aroma is not so good. Im not sure what it is I smell- turnips? The flavor is really nice with a huge chocolate and roasted taste. The smoothness is helped by a pronounced oat flavor. This could almost be a breakfast barleywine! Really good beer in spite of the odd aroma.

3939,"Aroma was roasty, malrty and sweet. Pours dark black with some head and a medium mouth feel. Flavor is a bit of bisquit chocalate, carmel, brown sugar! and some molasses.. Very well Done
",5
3940,"The aroma of this black, sweet stout is all malt.  You can smell the roasted and chocolate malts immediately.  Upon pouring, a thick, brown head develops slowly.  The molasses comes through nicely; just a hint of coffee and chocolate as well.  I would prefer more hops, but this is a tasty, filling stout that does not disappoint.
",5
3941,"Tap at the brewery. Pours a dark clear brown, sizeable beige head. Aroma is light roasted malts. Taste is quite roasty, finishes with a touch of chocolate, bitter hops. Not bad for a middle of nowhere brewery.
",5
3942,"Draft @ brewpub. Lemony yellow. Cloudy and looks like lemon curd. Stable head. Aroma of lemon ice. Delightfully sour, intense, and lactic. Super tart. Nice lemon curd pocket is very refreshing because it finishes with acidity. Minty or basil notes add accents. Difficult to rate overall because its thin but a lot of fun.
",5
3943,"Draught at the brewpub.  Cloudy greenish-yellow.  Celery aroma with a little funky tartness.  Tart, maybe with a hint of sweetness.  Celery and light citrus taste, along with lots of wheat.  An assertive, slightly strong and very wheaty interpretation.
",5
3944,"Had this beer at the All Colorado Beer Fest on 11/10/2007.  Aroma is light with with just a hint of malt.  Color is an brownish gold with good carbonation and a thick fairly tight head.  Taste is mild all the way around with light malt flavor and very light hop flavor.  Its just not as bold as I feel a Mrzen should be.
",1
3945,"Draught at All Colorado Beer Festival.  Pours clear orange with a spare, fizzy, white head, diminishing with spare lacing.  Aroma is average malt (bread, caramel, nutty), light hops (herbs, grass), average yeast (dough) with notes of brown sugar.  Light bodied, thin texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish.  Average duration, light sweetness and acidity, moderate bitterness.
",1
3946,"The smell of fermented honey is balanced nicely with estery hop notes.  This ale is clear, with a light, golden color, reminiscent of a pilsener-style lager.  Upon tasting, the honey makes its presence known, followed by a slight hop bitterness.  The finish is clean.  This ale seems to please the domestic-beer drinkers and the geeks as well.
",5
3947,"Draft @ brewpub. Nice amber color. A Vienna shade. Aroma is sweet smoke and caramel. Flavors are subtle, buttery smoke, caramel, brown sugar (some). Continues to have a predominantly caramel and smoke finish. Is clean, thin, and unexciting but overall nice.
",1
3948,"A lightly smoked Vienna by billing, Ladder Truck probably refers to the building next door that burned down, hence the smoked malt.  Golden-amber.  Bright.  The aroma is smooth amber biscuity malts.  The palate is mostly biscuit, too, but with a touch of smoke.  A nice, easy-drinking light-bodied lager with lots of flavour.

3971,"Bottle (330ml): Greenish-golden coloured, small white foamy layer, quickly vanishing; faint grainy hoppy and a bit sweet-malty nose with traces of cardboard; moderate to distinctive bitter-sweet flavour, light bodied to watery. Short bitter-sweet finish with the faintest illusions of a malty base. Even though the bohemian border can be reached from Waldsassen easily by bike, this brew is very far away from a Bohemian Pilsener....

3972,"(33cl bottle, with thanks to pivnizub) Clear, pale golden colour with a short foamy white head. Quite strong grassy hops aroma with a light-sweet malty background. Initially slightly sweet malty taste with grassy hops; light to medium bodied, crispy carbonation; dry and bitter, grassy hoppy finish. This one tastes more like a Pils from the Sauerland and has not much in common with those brewed in the Bohemian style.

3973,"500ml bottle from bierzwerg!	The beer in the glass has a very cloudy, light yellow color, the head is high, fine-creamy and very durable. Smells really very yeasty, fruity and slightly acidic minimal. Startis good recent, tangy, yeasty, and above all very sweet and fruity. Something Ive been treated, never.

3981,"Bottled. Hazy brown color, medium off-white head. Aroma of caramel malt, slight roasted, german hops, which give it the typical wurzig/herbal character of a German beer. Too bad, this doesnt fit too good with a dutch style dark bock, which is usually a bit sweet. And so is this bock. So, its a bit of a mix between a german dunkel and a sweet dutch bockbeer.

4041,"Different brews can vary wildly in style. From deep brown and tart to light and Wit-like. Very much an acquired taste and generally not appreciated by anyone except the islanders themselves. I have a story Id like to share. Back in the days of the cold war I was doing military service on the island. On new years eve about 20 or so of us had to stay while all the others went to celebrate with friends and family. Somehow one of the locals managed to conjure up about 40 liters of ""dricke"". We made a campfire on the beach looking out over a wintery Baltic sea and had one hell of a party. The evening ended with everyone not from the island (except me) being very sick. That is dricke for you, dangerous stuff! 
",1
4042,"From a plastic bottle.  Generously shared by cquiroga.  Cloudy, light caramel colored pour with a wispy 		head of off-white.  Fruity nose of pears, apples, and coconut milk, along with hints of muscat grapes and musty 		leather.  Lots of fruity esters and a honey like sweetness provide an almost ""juice""-like base, funked up with 		some barnyard notes and peppery phenols.  Medium light bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel with a gentle, 		tingling effervescence.  Sweet white grape and waterchestnut flavors up front, along with some ripened pear.  A 		mild smokey nuttiness tries to peek in, but is drowned out by the light fruits and horsey funk.  The wildness of 		the beer seems to have taken over some of the other spice nuances; it would be enlightening to try a fresh example 		side-by-side.  Thanks for the rare treat, Chris!

4043,"Bottle @ Dr. Bills.  The brewer name kicks ass.  Poured a hazy amber color with no head.  Dry spiced aroma with notes of fruit and leather.  The flavor was tart and fruity.  Big leather and notes of pear.  Light tingle of carbonation on the tongue.

4044,"UPDATED: MAR 24, 2007 Courtesy of omhper and drank as a horizontal alongside Jackelsdricka for comparison.  Pours mahogany and more or less still with no bubbles and only a hint of tingliness on the tongue.  Smells strongly of juniper with hints of spruce, birch and mineral water.  Taste is like a gin might be if it were a fermented beverage with loads of juniper and lots of booziness.  Some hints of smoke are also present.  Palate is very thick and reminds me of the heavy mineral waters of Europe.  Finishes along the lines of sassafras.  Very different from everything else I tried during this tasting that included sahtis, and lots of traditional Scandanavian beers.  If sahti and lambic are the grandparents of beer, this is their great grand parent.  Thanks again for this rare treat!

4045,"Plastic bottle from omhper (big thanks, Ill try getting you some new sahtis for this one!). Hazy nutbrown colour, no head.

4046,"Fresh sample, brewed by my friends mom for a wedding. Sampled in a very traditional plastic mug ;-) Hazy orange, no head but residual bubbles. Huge aroma, yeasts, esters, fruit (not dark malty types) and a slight almost lambic-like funkiness. Taste is upfront sour, yeasty with a definite alcohol presence. Not sure if I can pick out the juniper.. Palate is rich, sticky with a loong finish. There is no carbonation. This is great stuff, really happy to have tried it.

4047,"1 year old stored in plastic bottle - Thanks a lot Per for bringing it to Denmark!!Pours hazy orange with no head. Lots of smoke, tar and ropes in the aroma with hints of sweet orange. Very odd and very extreme! Dry flavor with lots of smoke and fruit. Very weird and very interesting but a little too much in the long run. Still very fun to taste!

4048,"Stored by Per for 1 year in plastic containers and plastic bottlesFlat, hazy amber color. Very nice and original smokey aroma, almost like sausages, and very light fruitness, and something I cant detect. Some sweetness, pretty sweet, a lot smokey, some liquorice (?), light herbs Crazy beer, but not bad, very original. Thanks Per for bringing this one!.

4049,"Sampled with omhper, tiggmtl, MartinT, muzzlehatch, and Rastacouere in Montreal.  Thanks to Per for this amazing sample.  This I believe is from Burs (not sure if that is the some farmer, or a part of gotland).  Aroma is very smoked.  Smells like campfires/burning tires.  Vinous and very interesting aroma.  Hazy amber/honey color with a very small white head.  Smoked to start.  Fruity, campfirey, and leathey.  Thin bodied.  Quite strange and I am sure it requires a specific palate to enjoy this sub-style.

4050,"Burning wood, hugely fuity (peach), smoked aroma. Opaque orange-tan coloured, heavy, still and viscous looking with no head at all. Charred blackened, salted peach flavour. Palate is oily, heavy and still. A very interesting experiment. I glad to have had the chance to try this, but after the initial few sips, I found this difficult to consume. Bottle (plastic) enjoyed with DYCSoccer17, MartinT, muzzlehatch, Omhper and Rastacouere.

4051,"omhper in Montreal #15 (with MartinT,tiggmtl,Rastacouere,DYCSoccer).  Plastic (500 ml?) bottle provided by Per...an amazing gift (burs version).  Bright pale orange, no carbonation...smoky, funky cheeses and fruitwoods in the nose, wildy woody and farmy...simply fantastic aromas!  Very flat, smoky peaches and apricots in the flavor...the thin body allows the heavy smokiness and charred character to overwhelm.  Difficult to drink even a small sample, nonetheless its really amazing to be able to try this!
",5
4052,"Burs version. Hazy orange apperance, almost still looking. Huge smokey aroma. Unique leather/juniper match, extremely meaty. Floral and wheaty (in the small acidity) feel. Apricot and peach pie flavors, a fieldish campfire on the tongue, this is strikingly tasty and demands all your concentration. Very weird as it has this farmhouse character combined with the deep smokiness of strict Bamberg styles. Thin-medium body, low carbonation. This style is a must seek!
",5
4053,"(From Burs) : Sitting in a tree inhaling the intense smoke of a fruit-harboring wood cabin whose fire has just been extinguished by torrential rain...Very humid and woody smoke, impossible to escape from (I not necessarily trying to), with a garrulous fruitiness of junipers (real) and apricots (fictive)...Honey impersonations and earthy bitterness rising in the end...Perhaps smokier than a Schlenkerla, an incredibly memorable experience which I hope to relive again...Immense thanks Per!!...

4054,"An unclear brown beer with no head. The aroma is very smoked and with notes of rope and oranges. The flavor is sweet and is very smoked before ending on a dry note. Too simple a flavor.

4055,"Thanks Per, again a very unusual beer.   Cloudy brown color, it looks like a fresh glass of apple cider.  No head what so ever.   Aroma is smoke and as Bov  said, almost like bacon.  The flavor is sharply smokey with an oily mouthfeel.  Slight sourness on the finish mixed with more smoke.

4063,"Reddish brown and somewhat cloudy in both color and appearance. Creamy, well maintained off white head. Sharp burnt/smoky aroma and flavor with a pronounced alcohol mouthfeel. Interesting  yet undeterminable after taste which I assume to be juniper. Moderate carbonation. Its the opportunity to experience such rare treasures like this that make life so rewarding. Many thanks to Per.
",5
4064,"Update 2002-02-20: The new batch I tried was more fresh, somewhat sparkling from the still ongoing fermentation in the bottle, and beautifully hazy. There are definitely some smokey juniper flavour. The main characteristics of the beer seem intact from the last batch I tried though.	Older comments:	This is actually the same version as Oakes tried. It was made on a farm in Stnga on central Gotland.	Nut-brown. Non carbonated, sweetish and soft, some bitterness, restrained smokiness, as compared to the few other versions Ive tried.
",5
4065,"Still, as per the style;  muddy dark amber (not very attractive, but true to style); aroma: smoke, pear, vanilla, lots of malt.  Palate: smokey up front, followed by sweet malts & a late hint of juniper.  A lot of rich fruitiness comes through as well, and it finishes slightly tart - complex and delicious.

4066,"Peterborough Beer Festival...ages ago - just found the rating slip.  This beer is clear amber with a small bubbly head.  Aromas are toffee, spices and hops.  Flavours are pear, toffee and an earthy character.  Dry on the finish.  Good stuff.

4067,"Sampled on cask at Market Porter in Southwark along with SilkTork.  Pleasantly honeyish sweet, fruity aroma, perfumed and lightly citric.  Light-medium golden color, clear, with a head that diminished entirely.  Flavor is indeed vaguely cidery and fruity, a moderate amount of malt sweetness is present, with a nicely hoppy, floral, balanced finish.  Palate is virtually free of effervescence, body is medium.  Refreshing and unique, highly drinkable and better than anticipated overall.

4082,"500ml swingtop bottle at Sokol resturant, Ljubljana, Slovenia 	This is considered their ""house beer"", and was very much looking forward to trying it.	Hazy orange body, with small inpersisant ring of white foam.	Aroma is bit towards the odd side; honey sweetness, clove, stewed apple, and overly ripe banana.	Low carbonation, soapy texture, body is a bit on the lean side.	More honeyish malt flavours on the body, odd peppery phenolics and clove. Overly ripe banana and pear esters linger on a drying finish.	Certainly a unique beer, im somehow reminded of a homebrewed wheat beer of sorts; its part one thing, part another. I have a feeling its could inconsistant in quality/flavour but well worth a try.

The nose is definitely nice, grainy, very finely hoppy and honeyish. Oooh, I think Ive hit a good batch. Damn tasty. Very fine chewy hops (Goldings?), a bit dusty, grainy and ends up a little in the rice cracker territory. Very light notes of carrots that usually ruin everything for me but this time they dont. Fine body. Refreshing and definitely a treat while sitting on the patio in one of the prettiest parts of Ljubljana with friends, resting after a train ride.

4096,"Cloudy dark golden lager with actual sediments in it. The smell is indeed a bit yeasty, but coming mostly bready which works quite well with the soft malts that display similar characteristics. Strawy, rather crisp, sweetish malts are tamed by a nicely slicing flowery bitterness.

4100,"Cloudy dark bronw beer topped by a thin off-white head. Pretty strange roasty nose reminds me of burnt buckwheat galettes which is not a particularly pleasant smell, but reminds of fond memories and hits the spot. Besides that, it stays focused on rather sweet, biscuit meets toffee sugary malts. Fortunately, the carbonation does the necessary cleansing job to reduce the sugary feel from that surprisingly frail body	. Far from perfect, but still one of my favourite Slovenian dunkels from possibly my favourite brewer in the country.

4167,"On draught at the brewpub.  Pours a slightly cloudy amber into the glass, with a diminished head that leaves sparse lace. The nose is of light citrus and florals. Flavors are bitter, citrusy, with more than a hint of clove added. The lingering bitter finish is accompanied by a medium body and lively palate. Although the mouthfeel is cleansing, it is a tad like a hop tea, with the balance not quite up to par in the malt arena to equal out the active bitters.

4168,"This place had no beer list so I going on what my server recited to me as their offerings on the day. I can only assume this is their swamp fox IPA. Pretty light on the hops here and if I were classifying this thing it would be a straight APA. Maybe my view was skewed by the infection though too. Diacetyl all the way sucking the life out of this drink. The only other thing I got here was a light grain aroma, wheat, bread.
",1
4169,"The aroma was malty and a little yeasty with a bit of a staleness in the background. Caramel and citrus were notable but lurking behind. The beer arrived crystal clear amber golden with a low white head which was tight bubbled and lasted to lace the glass. The flavor was nicely malty and citrusy with orange and grapefruit coupled to caramel. The beer was well balanced with a nice bittering aspect which lasted long into the dry finish. The aftertaste was citrusy and pleasant. The body was medium with a moderate level of carbonation and a creamy texture on the palate. The aroma was a bit odd, but the flavor was great. Served a bit too cold, but a nice brew.	Nip glass (8 oz) at Quigleys.
",5
4170,"On draught at the brewpub.  It pours mahogany with a reduced ring head that leaves ring lace. The nose is roasted and malty, clean. Roasted malt flavors with licorice and cloves noted; nice touch to the style. Some nuttiness hits mid-palate and finishes with a nut skin crisp hop. Soft carbonation lends a smooth mouthfeel.  Decent nut brown, and an interesting take on the style with the lightly numbing licorice and clove.  Enjoyable.
",1
4171,"Quite unceremoniously, this was my first growler purchase ever. What a better way to hang at the beach than to grab a growler of a brewpub beer. This was much better than their IPA. Poured an opaque brown colo. Nice nutty almost strangely sweet aroma. Big almond flavor. Medium body, decent carbonation and a pretty dry finish.
",5
4172,"On draught at brewpub. Amber-brown pour with a thick sudsy head that leaves thick lace. The nose is of caramel, pale malt and English bitters.  Flavors are much the same, with some caramel, melon, lightly metallic notes hitting mid-pull, and ends with some tea tannins and a crisp bitter finish.  Its very reminiscent of an ESB in the body; thinner and showing some skins/tannins in the mouth, but it does have substance on the palate, without being overtly complex. Makes for an easy summer quaff. Light and refreshing.
",1
4173,"Growler from brewpub. Pours is a clear red. These guys make some solid beers assuming they are not infected. Toasted grain aroma a little more on the wheat side. Caramel malt aromas as well. Clean and clear flavors up front with a bitter and dry finish. Nice grassy hop finish with some citrus peel that lasts for a while.
",5
4174,"On draught at the brewpub. Pours black with mahogany fringes, accompanied by a thick tan head and lace. The nose is of roasted chocolates. Flavors bring roasted malt with some light cherries. The finish touches on some licorice. The mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth. This one is light, fluffy and easy drinking.  Not bad.
",5
4175,"On draught at the brewpub. Pours a hazy straw brown with few suds to retain a head or leave lacing. The nose is of light grain and corn. The flavors are far too subdued, very little to comment on with the exception of a tiny grain finish.  The palate is seltzery with a thin body and overactive carbonation. Unfortunately, this is the ""light"" beer they brew to match the major brewers, but it remains watery with no substance.
",1
4176,"On draught at the brewpub. It pours a cloudy grapefruit hue, with a small suds head that leaves light lace. The nose is of heavy yeast and sours. Lots of dough and yeast flavors, a hint of citrus, and a slightly grainy finish. The body is smooth with a creamy palate. Not very complex, and a bit underwhelming.
",1
4177,"The aroma contained a citrusy note with a light banana ester and a nice wheat presence with just a hint of clove. The beer arrived crystal clear golden amber with a low lasting white head which laced the glass. The flavor was nice with wheat leading the charge. That was followed by a estery banana flavor and a nice clove phenolic. The finish went dry with lasting clove into the aftertaste. The body was medium with a moderate carbonation and the beer was crisp on the palate. Not a bad hefe, just a bit subdued. Nip glass (8 oz) served with a lemon on the lip of the glass.

Dark malt gives a very poor insipid weak base with a slight note of burnt toast and diluted ribena juice. Poor hop content in the weak aftertaste, can just about make out a dusty bitter note. Weak malty watery finish, one of the worst bodies I have come across, completely lacking in depth and complexity. An Old Ale in style but failing on all levels. One to avoid.

4254,"August 09. 2005, ""The Seaforth"" in Ullapool, Scotland, bottle, cold. Re-rated at home in Denmark later on. Its a black/brown beer with a moderate head. the aroma has weak notes of roasted malt and aroma hops. The flavour is thin as well, but I look hard, I do find discrete notes of licorice, caramel and coffee. The finish is slightly bitter. If it had had some more power and fuller body, it would have been a really nice beer.

4269,"Very average and uninteresting for the colour, this thin, acidic brew has hints of treacle and caramel.  (Cask @ Reading BF)
",1
4270,"Bottled.  Dark with red tints.  Aromas are floral, earthy and citrus.  Flavours are caramel and chocolate with some citrus which is odd for a porter.  Too much carbonation.  Some earthines that I would expect but doesnt seem true to the style.
",1
4271," Cask Conditioned, @ the Pigs Ear Festival London.  Dark with a mahogany trim. Has no head. Dark but empty, theres no much malt or toast to go with the colour. If you wait long enough though, there is a really late bitter kicker.
",1
4272," Gravity fresh @ Pig's Ear Festival, East London.  A number of brewers are labelling their fruity soft milds as porters. This is one. Soft yeasty aroma. Fruity with just enough acidity to justify the porter label, but only just. Pleasant enough.
",1
4273,"UPDATED: FEB 18, 2006 Very dark red/black beer in the porter style. Authentically dry and definitely, as the brewery suggests, has caramel overtones. However, whilst this was a respectable effort - and anyone who has the balls to set up a micro in the previously real ale desert of the Outer Hebrides and manages to get it shipped to London deserves full marks for effort - I found this a little thin and with insufficient complexity to merit very high marks. Nonetheless, very pleasant and a style that is not too common these days, so deserves every encouragement. The Speaker, London SW1, September 2003.
",1
4274,"(Cask conditioned). Sampled at the Wear Valley CAMRA Beer festival, where it was served at room temperature with no carbonation whatsoever. Dark ruby colour, exquisite aroma, a bit thin mouthfeel, pleasant mild spicy flavour. Recommended! Would love to try it again, preferably slightly cooler at a Hebridean pub.

4275,"Tasted this at the Paisley Beer Festival in April 2005. Cask, gravity dispense. Clear copper red in colour with a thin white head. Strong malt in the sweetly intense fruit aroma. rich resiny mouthfeel and poor lacing. Strong pale malt component gives a robust maltloaf note with strong plum notes coming through, laced with sweet gycerine fruit. Robust hop resins give a pine note to the long aromatic aftertaste. Finish is powerful and malty with golden syrup notes really evident in warming alcoholic notes. This is an excellent old IPA style ale and highly recommended.

4280,"On cask at The Bow Bar. Pours a red - orange colour with a fair beige head. Aroma of caramel, treacle, candy sugar and clotted cream. A big alcohol hit with other flavours of treacle, caramel and yeast. Mild carbonation and an oily mouth-feel. A long alcohol hum also. Alcohol overpowers here with no real sense of balance.
",1
4281,"Bottle from Sainsburys. It pours deep red-brown, with a quickly dissipating bubbly off-white head. The nose is sweet fruit, varnish, wood, earth, salted liquorice, raspberry and floral. The taste is wood, astringency, currant, raisin, grapefruit, earth, alcohol warmth, chocolate and liquorice, with a dry-woody finish. It is medium bodied and has sharp carbonation. Decent enough.
",1
4282,"Bottle. Murky orange with an uncontrollable, spiralling carbonation feeding a tall uneven head. Completely schizophrenic aroma veering from deeply unpleasant rusty tin can notes (at first)  to marmalade, bath foam, pineapple and acetone in one sniff. Hints of cake and sulphur. Red apple peel in tupperware/apple strudel taste like White Shield. Earthy malts, spicy yeast. Bay leaf custard piped with TCP and heartburn. Isnt that one of Hestons? IPA like it (probably) used to be; eye-watering, nose-wrinkling, hairs-on-chest stuff.

4285,"50cl bottle from the Hogs Back Brewery Shop. A hazy gold colour with a fast fading white head; the aroma is full of tropical fruits; the taste is quite sour and fruity with a medicinal aftertaste; the alcohol is quite evident; and the whole effect is slightly disturbing. Not to my liking.

4286,"My first brew in Scotland. Thanks to Stuart. Pours a dark brown color with a think white head. The aroma is fruity, some toffee and yeast. The flavor is a very rich and warm fruity flavor with caramel and toffee. Quite thin. Light hops. Enjoyable.

",1
4301,"Bottle, Rainhall Drinks, Barnoldswick. Great name, but sadly not a great beer and surely not an IPA as the claim states. Poured a murky orange colour with a vanishing head. Grassy, farty, stale malt aroma. Not enticing. Initially thought this might have been off. Flavour is strange; herby, possible gooseberry, sweet malt, with a slightly unpleasant sourness that sullied this for me. Alcohol is pretty well masked, but this largely fails elsewhere. A whole bottle is a chore to get through.
",1
4302,"Cask at GBBF08. OK malty aroma. Clear brown colour. Almost no head. The flavour is quite caramelly. Does not taste its ABV until the finish where the alcohol burns a bit.

",1
4304,"Cask (GBBF 2008) - Copper brown in colour. Fruity and hoppy taste with raisins and grapefruit. Fairly rich and smooth with a bit of an alcoholic kick in the finish. Like a cross between a barley wine and an IPA in some ways. Interesting.

4305,"Cask, Blackfriars, Inverness.  Certainly warms you up on a Scottish winter night!  A good strong Scottish ale with a good amount of hops and full-on flavour.
",1
4306,"Dark red. Sweet mandarin aroma, quite appealing, that later developed some maltiness. Oily taste, rather thin, and consisting mainly of slightly surgical alcohol. A hint of coffee and some late bitterness. Despite the rather cute aroma, the overall effect is not to my taste.
",1
4307,"This was bought in Morrisons a while back, when poured it was VERY murky, almost opaque, head was ok tho! Flavourwise it was quite hoppy but overall it was unbalanced and, well...not very good! I bought a couple of bottles and both were the same, storage conditions perhaps?
",1
4308,"A Mes rate: Gravicask at Manc Winter Fest.Dirty golden brown coloured. Sorry for this but it smells like someone pooed their pants then sat on it for a few hours. Flavour is not quite so offensive but far from great. Hay, manure, lots of sweet malt and raw alcohol. Tases like it is some way from being ready and as a result, not great at all.
",1
4309," Cask at National Winter Ales Festival, Manchester 2008  Poured darkish brown some malt and sourness on the nose. Tasted very disappointing, really quite rough and fierce. The bitterness was good but aside from that I struggling for positives, sour at times and then the sweetness of the malts come through,  it came across as a ropey homebrew I afraid.
",1
4310,"Cask, Blackfriars, Inverness. Had just a couple hours in Inverness between buses (not nearly long enough--what a pretty city), but Blackfriars is all of five minutes walk from the bus station, so I did have time for a couple of pints.		Pleasantly surprised to see something strongish on the tap list. A very dark copper, slight haze, small fine off-white layer of head. Rich gingerbread aroma, nice butter touch, a little hay. Flavor has a full Christmas pudding malt richness, ginger and cinnamon, some dried figs. The finish is surprisingly dry and clean, with just a little lingering grape skin. After a fairly long string modest and forgettable pints, this beer makes me very pleased. Extravagant and generous, rather than elegant or delicate. Just what I needed to fortify me for the long ride back South...
",5
4311,"Spiced honey nose.  Pours muddy light brown.  More sweet malt in the flavour covering the alcohol but engendering a cloying quality.  At the end the alcohol shows itself in a bitter astringency.  Overall its drinkable but not exceptional in any way.

4312,"Bottle: Deep golden to light amber coloured, small, lacing and persistent off-white head, distinctive fruity (dark berries) and dark-malty nose with a tinge of molasses and hops in the wings; medium to full bodied, full sweet-bitter flavour; solid malty-fruity finish with hops and warming alcohol in the aftertaste. A moreish strong brew.....

4316,"[cask at Bon Accord] Big malty aroma, dried fruit, dates, some background citric notes. full body, very sweet upfront, leads to a restrained bitterness. This is in no way an IPA and the alchol shows a bit more than id like, but still a very nice beer.

4319,"Cask (gravity dispense) at Battersea Beer Festival 2006. A bronzed copper coloured beer. Difficult to categorise. Certainly not a ""Stout, Porter or Old Ale"", which the festival programme suggested. Toffee malt aroma. Fruity with a slight vinous tang. Sweetish, becoming a bit sickly. Alcohol is not very apparent. lacks clout for a big beer. Full marks for trying though.
",1
4320,"Half pint gravity fed at the Battersea Beer Fest, slightly cloudy but golden amber with a frothy white head. A very rich malty aroma with hints of cherry and honey.

Plums and prunes on the nose at first, followed by wood and smoke.  Flavour is sweet and smokey up front with a strong tea-like astringency through the middle.  Some woody hop notes in the background.  Quite velvety mouthfeel, low carbonation and a dry finish.  More a wee heavy than a pale ale, in fact its almost false advertising.  I can, however, certainly imagine 19th century beer tasting like this....

4329,"Described as an IPA on the bottle. I dont think so. Aroma heavily alcohol, whiskey. Malt dominant in flavour, although resinous hops present. Metallic, thin mouthfeel for its strength. I think theyre trying for an Orkney Skullsplitter kind of vibe, but call it a Scottish Strong Ale guys (or put more hops in).
",1
4330," Bottle. BBE Dec 04.  This doesn't taste fresh. It's a typical pasteurised bottle product. It has a dead leather look about it. Aroma is of a vintage ale - musty cardboard. Fairly flat, though there is some light carbonation. Heavy oily hops mingle well with neutral pale malt to produce a muddy flavour that never distinquishes itself, but certainly has a certain oomph. You know there's flavour here, but it's not delicate, it's not fresh, and it aint that grand.

4360,"Murky orange-brown. Frankly this beer looks awful. Its rare for me to give a 2 for appearance. I dont have a word in my vocabulary to describe the aroma, though its one Ive noticed in several beers. Perhaps aspirin soaked in vinegar? Quite a lot of sourness in the taste, though its slightly better than what has gone before. And some marmite, I think. A little bitterness of the aspirin variety to follow.

4362,"Cask, The Phoenix, Inverness. Dark copper, lovely buttercream pale yellow head, fine and densea very pretty pint. Malt loaf and blackberry aroma, gently bell-toned. Exceedingly young tasting. Soft and sweet in a cream way, rather than a sugar way. As a young unpolished ale it has some charming points, but along the lines of taking a sip from the fermenter for interests sake, rather than something youd want by the pint.

4410,"From the bottle at the De Heeren 20th Anniversary party during last weeks trip to Belgium. Reviewed from notes.		Served in an Orval mini chalice.		Poured a moderate plum-brown color with a thick and foamy off-white head and some pretty good lacing on the way down.		The nose first brought forward quite a bit of brown-sugar-like sweetness without enough yeast character. Its clear from the start that this needed better attenuation. Mild caramel and a faint bit of dark fruit.		Body was too sweet and the finish too full.		On a side note, we had this again later in the week at the abbey cafe. That sample was too dry rather than too sweet, so there may be some inconsistencies at this point. Given that Chimay is brewing it, I imagine it could be recipe changes rather than brewing errors.
",1
4411,"An old trappist that is new again! A cloudy dark caramel hued pour. Big off-white creamy head. Dies down slowly and leaves a ton of lacing. Smells malty, yeasty, and a bit metallic. Taste is bitter and sweet. Dry. A bit of a yeast taste lending a pepper bite. Carbonic bite. A little more sweet than bitter in the back. Reminds me of Chimay Rouge.

4412,"Thanks to Thorpe for this baby. AttheDHL fest. Murky caramel color, medium off white head, tons of suspended particles, looks like space junk. Aroma of malty butterscotch. Taste has a sweet start, bitter finish. Very malty with hefty spice. An interesting newcomer.
",1
4413,"I received a 33cl bottle from a friend in Belgium (thanks Bart!). I poured it into a Trappist chalice.Appearance: Even without the yeast the body is extremely hazy, opaque shade of brick red and pumpkin orange. Forms a normal-sized, yellowish sudsy head which retains well but doesnt lace.Smell: Surprisingly weak nose with mostly floral/perfume-like fragrance and hints of dark fruit. Taste: Its difficult to pin down a definitive story about this beer as different sources on the Internet have different stories as to whether Mont des Cats Biere Trappiste is indeed a Trappist beer and if so, what style it falls under. The label seems to indicate its an amber ale, which I would agree with. It lacks the robustness and complexity of an Abbey Dubbel.The palate here is rather simple: light flavors of dark fruit up front with a sharp, almost sour sensation of tobacco and smoke on the second half and an aftertaste to match. Only light bitterness through the middle, with plenty of maltiness otherwise. That being said, this is still a mild beer overall. The flavors seem diluted. Not that theres anything off-putting about it, but it just doesnt seem like something youd expect from a Trappist monastery . Mouthfeel: The liquid is thin, but heavily carbonated. It foams up in the mouth and leaves a slightly sour, astringent aftertaste.Drinkability: If theres one thing the monks are good at - its hiding the alcohol and thats true of this brew, too. At 7.6% ABV there is zero alcohol presence in the nose, taste, or weight of the beer. The carbonation dances across the tongue and gets stuck in the throat. Not what I would consider a smooth beer until the end when it seems to become borderline watery.Overall, Mont des Cats Biere Trappiste is a decent beer to be sure, but not nearly as good as youd expect considering who its made by.

4461,"Pours a perfectly cloudy dark brown, with a nice light head.  A great looking beer.  Aroma is mainly of fruit, and typical of the Dubbel style.  Taste is similar, but with a bit of yeast to complement the sweet peachy flavor.  Palate is a bit fizzy yet slick, especially at warmer temperatures.  Overall a VERY good Dubbel.
",5
4462,"Pours a regal deep amber cloudy color with a thick, creamy head.  Very complex and aromatic upon nosing, with sugestions of dark fruit cake, spiced brandy, raisins, molases, vanilla-caverndish tobacco, and rum-soaked cedar wood.  Full bodied, almost chewy with an oily mouthfeel.  Equally complex taste with hints of candied dark fruits infused in ancient oak-barrel-aged brandy.  The taste develops into suggestions of  burnt sugar, plumbs, oloroso sherry, and warm cinamon-raisin bread.  Long, warming, tappering finish with appetizing hop bitterness, and slightly acidic astringency with notes of tart black cherries, figs, vanilla, and spiced rum.  Try with a tradition monastery-prepared dark fruitcake drenched with brandy or cognac.  Also try with cherries jubilee or Banana fosters desert with vanilla bean icecream.
",5
4463,"Cloudy reddish brown with off white head.  Aroma of brown sugar and raisins.  Woody flavor with dried fruits.  Good flavor of fruits  and sugar.  Just a bit of bitterness.  Overall a very nice trappist ale.
",5
4464,"Pours a cloudy, dark red with a small white head. Flavor is fruity and mildly sweet.
",5
4465,"Cloudy and murky with bits of goodness floating around.thin to no head after initial pour. Fruit taste turns to malt then hops. Raisin or dates. I like all the Chimay offerings.
",5
4466,"Copper color with a off-white bumpy head. Flavor is sweet fruit and nuts with a touch of hops. A nice smooth, dry and slightly bitter finish, very fine carbonation. Very good dubbel - a fine compliment to the Indian food that I ate with it.
",5
4467,"Another one of my favorite Beligum beers.   reddish brown in color.  Very smooth and consistent flavor
",5
4468,"Reddish brown with a thick off white head. Lightly spiced and floral aroma is fairly faint. Clove spice and a nice fruity sweetness at the end. Very smooth and carbonated.
",5
4469,"bottle poured into a chimay trappist glass has a thick copper amber color with lots of floating sediment and active carbonation. when held to the light the sediment is brought up with the carbonation and falls back down the sides of the glass, very pretty. aroma has sweet fruit, yeast, caramel, and flower pollen. flavor is well balanced, apricot coming through, light malted bitterness, flowery pollen, and some alcohol. mouth feel is medium with plenty of carbonation and a complementing texture. the yeast is what really stands out and makes this beer.
",5
4470,"Ok. For my 100th beer I wanted something special. This is it. May not be the best trappist out there but ""for the money"" its great. Recommend this one as a ""seat down and sip two or three beer"" types. Love it.
",5
4471,"A- Pours a dark reddish brown with a massive doughy head.		S- Smell is sweet, of dark fruits and berries. Hints of raisin bread peek through.		T- Taste is sweet hints of apricots, assorted fruit and alcohol come to the forefront of the flavor. Starts off strong and backs away fairly quickly leaving a syrupy lining that tastes a little like robutussin in my mouth.		M- The mouthfeel is slightly thin, highly carbonated.		D- This beer seems to suffer a bit when it comes to drinkability. I just not digging the sickening sweet aftertaste that coats your mouth.
",1
4472,"Deep dark, ruby red (almost brown?) pour with a sustaining off white head.  Light aroma of yeast and perhaps banana - well, now after I read the description - of course its apricot.  Full mouth feel with a long finish.  Creamy, malty, a hint salty and bitter.  Very good, consistent flavor.
",5
4473,"Weak fig aroma. Brown pour with a thick billowy cream colored head. Tastes of fig and marshmallow. Clean, alcohol slightly noticeable. Lacking collateral qualities, but tastes very good, unoffending.
",5
4474,"Pours dark copper with off white head. Aromas of bread, dough and dark fruits. Flavor is slightly sweet with lots of Belgian yeast and caramel, brown sugar. Medium body with lively carbonation and a slick mouthfeel. A very good abbey dubbel.
",5
4475,"You just cant go wrong when it comes to Chimay.  Yeasty flavors are dominant here, with some sweet brown candi sugar flavors, caramel and toffee, and just the slightest hint of dried dark fruits.  Delicious.
",5
4476,"Bottle pours a dark reddish brown with a thin off-white head.  Aroma is mostly sweet, brown sugar, yeast, caramel, dried fruit, and malt.  Rich, sweet, smooth flavor includes brown sugar, toffee, roasted malt, and dried fruit.  Very nice!
",5
4477,"Mid bodied, good carbonation. Dark red in color almost a maroon. This is a very good beer. Not too strong of a flavor but it has enough that it doesnt need to be that strong.
",5
4478,"Red, brown colored brew. Sweet, yeasty, malty aroma. Fruits, sweetness and malty flavor. Nice.
",5
4479,"UPDATED: JUN 13, 2008 11.20 Bottle: this is a very sexy beer, dark red color with white head that retains.  Aroma consists malt, hints of bananas, cream and alcohol.  Wonderfully rich silky taste consisting of sweet malt and prune with a slight banana taste.  The thing that stands out most in this beer is the rich taste.  It has a very slight hop taste hardly noticeable.  The richness lingers to a wonderful aftertaste that lasts.  ""Those Trappist monks know how to do it"" is what is thought and said out loud when drinking this.  Plus as stated on the bottle, ""A major part of the sales revenue is used by the monks to support charitable works."" Those Trappist monks...
",5
4480,"I cant believe Ive been on Rate Beer this long and havent rated this beer.  Admittedly my least favorite of the Chimay beers, still a nice Dubbel.  Sampled out of one of the little bottles.  Murky brown color with a big rocky beige head.  Light pit fruit nose with some dark sugar.  Warming alcohol sensation.  Tastes of ripe plum and other juicey fruits, and dark brown sugar sweetness.  Solid beer, and readily available.
",5
4481,"750 mL Magnum poured into a snifter.  Pours a pretty chestnut-red with a nice head.  Its very clear and I didnt really expect it to be.  Aroma is yeasty, malty and sweet.  The taste starts out very sweet with a large dose of plum and raisin flavors.  Very sweet.  Nice, dry finish, though.  Well balanced.  Quite different from the other Chimay beers, but I like this quite much.
",5
4482,"Grand Slam at the Beer Fest in the Poconos.  The aroma a bit roasty malt and spice.  Heady with a dark brown color.  Flavor is complex with sweet and smooth.  Roasty, sweet, bitter, and fizzy all at once and all in a sensible way.  Nice silky carbonation, very smooth.  Masterful.
",5
4483,"Best beer I have ever had...I am no professional but this is really some good stuff
",5
4484,"Bottle. Moderate malt aromas of roasted and nutty, light herbs for the hops, moderate notes of leather and broth for the yeast, with prune, wood, pepper and ahint of cola in the background. Head is fizzy, off-white, with a little lacing and is mostly diminishing. Color is hazy, but sparkling dark red/brown. Flavor starts lightly sweet and moderately acidic, then finishesmoderately acidic and bitter. Palate is medium, dry and watery, and it has a fizzy carbonation. Not as good as the blue and white but definitely an excellent sessoin beer.
",5
4485,"One of the best beers Ive ever had. The aroma is slightly sweet and roast-y, with a creamy mouth feel. The taste is almost like eating dark chocolate and fruit at the same time. Chimay Rouge is further proof that the best traditional beers come from Belgium.
",5
4486,"Again, used the Chimay glass for this one. Very nice smell, the trappist glasses really open up the aromas of these beers.  Spicy and fruity. flavor is slightly malty, I probably shouldve let this warm up a bit more as it was pretty cold and the flavor was a bit on the short side. Still a nice beer.
",5
4487,"big head on the poor, not enough lacing to speak of. beer is colored dark walnut. aroma is of a less potent belgian strong- spice, nuttiness, intiguing overall. reserved but delicious flavor of caramel, spice, hints of red wine and nutmeg as well. good mouthfeel, very very nice beer.
",5
4488,"Hazy dark amber with lots of residual yeast. Aromas of caramel, yeast, and a bit of spice. Mellow and reserved. Extremely smooth mouthfeel, spicy notes, and excellent malt backbone. A tad thin on the palate, but excellent despite.
",5
4489,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2010 Pours a murky dark brown color with an amber tint to it.  It is topped with a fizzy moderate sized head.  Head tapers off a bit but a bunch of frothy lacing remains.  There is a spicy fruitiness to the aroma but its faint.  The flavor is malty with a sugary dark fruit flavor.  Some spice mixed in. Pretty well balanced and smooth.  Id rank this third among Chimay beers behind the White and Blue but this is good.
",5
4490,"Bottle. drank this while slightly congested. most noticeable feature was the great mouth feel. Drank it when it was rather warm, resulting in noticeable darker fruit flavors. Goes down warm and very easy. Great beer.
",5
4491,"My favourite Chimay beer.  Nice copper pour with a creamy slighlty tan head.  A lot of fruit in the cent.  Fruit continues in the flavour, some caramel, some spice.  A slightly warming aftertaste.  I am a huge fan of this it just tastes great and goes down easy leaving a nice warm aftertaste.
",5
4492,"Small bottle, pours copper/brown with frothy off-white head.  Head dissipates, doesnt leave much lacing.  Aroma lightly fruity and hoppy, with taste of smoke, caramel, light hops, and dark fruit.  Initially lightly sweet and bitter, and a bit acidic.  Nice beer, but not quite as good as Chimay Blue.
",5
4493,"Small bottle.  Copper dark red pour with a foam head that settled quickly.  Sweet fruit aroma  of apricots/raisins.  Smooth on the pallet, blend of malt and sugary bread (yeast).  Some spicy bitterness in the finish.  Would have again but next is the Bleu.
",5
4494,"UPDATED: APR 12, 2008 Im getting the feeling that I dont really like dubbels. this one is borderline undrinkable for me. Not at all interesting.
",1
4495,"Pours a medium dark ruby brown.  Foams upon opening, but head dissipates quickly once in a glass.  Feels nice in the mouth, and the taste is even throughout (slight bitterness which is offset by sweetness and caramel flavors).  Not as complex as I expected, but it is a very welcoming beer.  I look forward to trying the other two Chimay brews for comparison.
",5
4496,"Bottle, 33 cl. Aroma of Belgian yeast, accompanying fruitiness, spices, licorice, honey, apple. Flavor largely the same, with a nice hop finish I not accustomed to in similar brews (although I think this may just be my palate developing). Typical fine carbonation for a Belgian, solid brew.
",5
4497,"Bottle.  Poured a dark brown with a creamy, light tan (1 cm) head that persisted.  Aroma of Belgian yeast, light fruits, and as it warmed, dark fruits (raisin, prune).  Initial taste of sweet light fruit (apple, pear, melon) and slight bitterness in the swallow.  Also an aftertaste of smoked beef (odd, I know).  A lighter version of the Bleu.  Drinkable and tasty.
",5
4498,"Pours a hazy red brown with a short-lived head. Aromas are very fruity. Taste is mainly of fruits like banana, figs, apples etc and some nice sweet malt presence. An easy drinking and pleasant Belgian, not overly sweet or strong in flavour.
",5
4499,"Very cloudy and brown with a light head that dissipates quickly after being dense initially. Hard to smell due to my congestion, but I did detect a fruity presence and some caramel. Slightly malty intro with a smooth sweet transition to a somewhat warming, mildly bitter finish.
",5
4500,"Dark & cloudy reddish brown colour with a thin beige head. Slightly fruity aroma. Full bodied with average carbonation. Light bitterness. Flavours spicy and sweet with some banana like flavours detected. Creamy/smooth mouth feel with a dry finish. Quite enjoyable.....  -330ml bottle.
",5
4501,"Cloudy dark  copper colour with a beige head. Not overly carbonated. Flavours of dark frut and slightly spicy.  Well balanced. The alcohol content gives a pleasant warmth but is not overbearing.  A lightly bitter and spicy finish. A very smooth and flavoursome  beer but not quite as good as the blue.
",5
4502,"...overall, a great all around beer, with a good dose of alcohol.  Nice flavor, with fruity apricot notes, as well as a nice color in the glass.  Very well balanced, and always a great beer, like most Trappist beers, they know how to do it.
",5
4503,"Cloudy reddish brown with a small pale head. Aroma is of caramel, dark fruits. Medium palate, flavours of brown sugar, citrus, a little nuttiness, and a bitter finish.
",5
4504,"Browish red body, tiny and bubbly head. Caramel, raisins, coriander seeds and early. Sweet body that sticks to the mouth, even with the watery texture. Long aftertaste and alcohol is well hidden. This is the opposite of refreshing and although well brewed I never got to like it really. Cheap. (33cl bottle, 1,60 EUR)
",5
4505,"Hazy light brown color with a pillowy head that hangs around for a bit. The flavor features big, full malt, a hint of hops to cut through the sweetness, and some apricot in the finish. Starts creamy and ends dry. Very interesting sensation. As it warms, I getting butterscotch and some pepper.		Overall, a sensational beer. Big flavors, great texture, complex, and balanced.
",5
4506,"330ml bottle. Pours a brown colour with a thick, light tan head. Aroma of Belgian candi sugar, caramel, treacle, yeast and light black pepper. Nice flavour of Belgian candi sugar, treacle, caramel and yeast again. Little fruitiness with blueberry and raisin notes. Foamy mouth-feel and a spicy, peppery linger. Nice.

4509,"First experience of Chimay beer - a few months ago. Il let the description say it all as I not good with beer descriptions! A wonderful tasting beer, apricot aroma, copper with a white head.  Simply superb.

4510,"Pours a reddish amber, white foamy head.	Spicy aroma, coriander, black pepper, wild cheesy yeast aroma.	Crisp sweetness.	Full bodied, oily, lively carbonation, long chewy finish.
",5
4511,"Copper with a fluffy head. Fruity aroma of pineapple. The flavour is like a weak version of Chimay Bleu: toffee, yeast, caramel,  plums and raisins. It has a somewhat weak mouthfeel, and lacks complexity. Its not bad though.
",5
4512,"Pours a mahogany colour with a beige head that lingers. Fruity aromas with notes of chocolate, caramel & spices. Palate is quite lively with a presence of fizziness, however the body is quite thin and not as complex as the other two Chimays. Still an enjoyable world-class dubbel.
",5
4513,"Bottle. Hazy red brown.  Palate is big and bubbly. Its peppry and malty fresh. Aroma has burnt sugar. Flavor is malty, yesty, sweet and warming.
",5
4514,"Fredagsbaren p Biologi, Aarhus	Bottled	Red colour	Yeast-fruity notes	Well hopped
",5
4515,"Nice bready and dark fruit aroma.  I like the flavor of this one.  Has notes of dark fruit, yeast, malt, and plenty of spice.  Nice balance of sweetness and bitterness.  Finishes crip.  Overall, a pretty good abbey dubbel.
",5
4516,"Pours an opaque coppery brown with medium sized, foamy head.  Aroma of tart fruit.  A little bite on the back of the tongue.  Flavors of bread, yeast, spice and just a hint of fruit sweetness.  For some reason, the alcohol doesnt seem to blend well with the flavor and seems to leave a taste all its own.  A good ""intro"" to Belgians, but not the finest example.
",5
4517,"Jamen det er kreds nr man fr en Chimay, og denne er da ogs helt og aldeles drikkelig.
",5
4518,"Dark rich brown beer with a touch of ruby and an off white head. Stunning sweet yeasty nose with complex fruit qualities. The flavour is full, doughy and perfectly balanced between sweet and bitter and the dry peppery finish is just lovely. A great dubbel.
",5
4519,"Just a great Belgian.  Brown pour with an off-white head.  Beautiful notes of dried fruit and sweet malt.  The same flavors dance across your palate.  A solid beer and a great starter for those that are ready to rise to the occasion and start drinking some more flavorful and refined beers.
",5
4520,"Bottle. Pours rich Mahogany with white head that slowly disperses. Malt aroma with fruit over tones. Nice spicy flavor with medium body.
",5
4521,"Not as good as the Blue, but really wonderful.  All Chimays are great beers.  Malty, dried fruits and spice.  Cheers!

4522,"~Pours a dark redish cider coulour with medium sized fluffy head.	~Scent of malts and fruit apricot and plums. A little spice.	~ Spicy, fruity flavor. Some corriander maybe.	~ Feels tingly and sharp. A bit chewy.	~ Eh, this beer is ok. Its a little too fruity and carbonated.	Upsets my stomache a bit. Chimay Bleu is definetly superior.
",1
4523,"Pours a dark coppery color with a thin off white head.  Aroma is mainly of yeast with some dark fruit.  The beer is actually relatively sweet with some sweet malt and fruit.  Light carbonation feel.  Decent beer, but I dont like it as much as others I feel.
",5
4524,"Bottle into my Chimay chalice. Nice thick foamy head is quickly dissipating. Notice the caramel brown color is lighter than many dubbels. Rusty rain, cane sugar, and caramel apple in the nose with hints of light fruits. Medium body with perfect amount of carbonation. Taste is similar to nose. A classic dubbel.
",5
4525,"Deep red-brown body, thick tan head. Bready nose with abundant esters. Spice and biscuit. Doughy body with sweet breads, toffee, plum, and surprisingly sharp alcohol. After warming, apple skin begins to become noticeable, but not so much as I remember in Chimay Blue. The prickly alcohol isnt carried especially well by the body, which is my sole complaint. Otherwise, I was pleasantly surprised by this beer.
",5
4526,"Aroma is breads, heavy malts, dark fruit. Flavor is the same with a hint of banana, bitterness is barely alive. Creamy smooth mouthfeel. A damn refreshing beer. My favorite dubbel yet.
",5
4527,"I liked this Chimay the least of the other two I have had. I would buy again but probably not anytime soon.
",5
4528,"UPDATED: MAR 12, 2008 A brown 11.2 oz bottle poured into a Chimay goblet.  Pours an Amber brown/burgundy with a hearty off-white head that remains on the glass well after the beer is gone. A decent, light lacing.  Yeasty, malty goodness on the nose. A mild hazelnut sweetness mixes with a floral perfume and a hint vanilla for balance.  Malt and yeast are first on the palate with a sweetness that tastes more like caramel than anything on the nose. I also pick up some clove. Alcohol comes through stronger than I would have expected, but pleasant. No real hops to speak of.  This has a creamy carbonated feel. I dont think Ive used those two words together before, but the carbonation hits first, then it settles down into a medium bodied creamy Dubbel.  Another great Ale from Chimay. Theyre always a treat, in moderation; savor it.
",5
4529,"Bottle. Dark maroon beer with no sediment, bright when held to the light. Big soda-like head that stays around like a good Belgian should. An understated aroma of raisins, plums, and sugars. The flavors mostly overplayed by the sharp, crisp, biting carbonation. Comes across very clean. Flavors of raisins and dark malts. Nothing here is strong or overwhelming, just well balanced and delicious.
",5
4530,"750ml bottle 	7.0% ABV 	I tried this beer on February 21st after purchasing from my local LCBO outlet.  The beer poured a reddish brown colour with a large, long lasting, rocky head.  The aroma was malty and yeasty with some hints of dark fruit.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied with mild carbonation.  The flavour was sweet matlt, with some yeast, and a small amount of bitterness.  A great beer.
",5
4531,"This is indeed a very good beer, but I prefer many other Trappist beers to this one. It is very light with a hint of citrus although it maintains its copper brown color. I would enjoy it a little heavier I think.
",5
4532,"Poured into a Chimay chalice. Head was not too thick, aromas of raisins and plums were prominent. Initial flavor of malts that ended quite suddenly, maybe it was still cold when I drank it. Still a nice beer.
",5
4533,"Beer poured copper colored with a big white head that slowly sank into a film covering the top of the glass.  Aroma was fruity with some banana and arpicot, and some phenolic spice.  Flavor is matly with fruity yeast esters, and some spiciness.  palate is soft and full of small bubbles.  A nice brew.
",5
4534,"not as tasty or as easy on the mouth as the Blue, but comparable. Fruited tastes with dark colors. Fragrant.
",5
4535,"Only had this one from the bottle. Leave lots of room for the ample head. Youll find this one in lots of places that the other Chimay colors wont show their faces. It is a good beer but better can be head for the dollar. Spring for th Blue Chimay (Grande Reserve) for a far superior brew and easier sging.

4536,"Bottle. BB 2005. Pours a hazy amber color with an off-white head. Has a fruity maalty and a little ueasty aroma with hints of dark fruit. Sweet malty dark fruit flavor with hints of yeast and honey. Has a warming sweetish malty finish with some hints of dark fruit in the aftertaste.

4538,"330 ml Bottle in namesake goblet:  Pours a murky burgundy colour under a beige head that vanishes.  Smells of plums, raisins, roasted malt and nuts.  Flavours of brown sugar apple sauce and prunes accented by rum and spice.  Dry-alcoholic end.  A solid and complex Trappiste offering.
",5
4539,"From 75cl bottle. Copper hazy body with a nice off-white head leaving a good lacing. Ripe banana, clove, bready nose with some hints of plum and apple. Sweet approach in mouth with lovely flavors of plum, vanilla, clove and wheat appearing in harmonious complexity. Silky consistency with a low carbonation gives a creamy texture to this brew which enhances well its flavors. Excellent beer, in the tradition of the brewer. Two thumbs up!
",5
4540,"This is a really interesting beer to rate.	Poured somewhat cold into a Chimay glass. Bottle from Total Wine.	Poured cloudy red with a small beige head with copious lacing. Smell is of bananna and yeast. Note as complex as Ive come to expect from an Abbey. The taste is incredible though with a truly awesome balance of light fruits, yeast, malt and a slight bitterness to the finish. This is how an Abbey Dubbel should be, take note Brasserie des Roc. This one is dangerously drinkable. Alchol is well hidden and the carbonation is very lively so its very easy going down.
",5
4541,"Pours dark tan, small head, earthen, limestone aroma, that comes of sharp. Slightly bitter, wooden, metallic, yeasty flavor. A  bit rough on the finish.
",5
4542,"Subtle. Faint sweet aroma. Clear copper-brown, wonderful but fleeting head.	Banana esters, sweet spices (eg cloves), ripe stone fruit (apricot), apple pie. Yeasty, bread and toffee in the mouth. Slight alcohol warming in the finish. Exquisite if unchallenging. I want to drink a lot of these.
",5
4543,"A good brew with some bitter apricot taste.  Good appearance that pours well, and its a beer that even the girls will enjoy (which is good when you dont want to waste the money on wine and a good Italian restaurant).
",5
4544,"Very smooth taste, great taste overall. Head was about half finger high at pour, dissipated quickly. The color reminded me of a dark apple cider. I really enjoyed this beer

4545,"aa wonderful creamy white head taste is fruity wtih a hint of apricot flavor. all in all this a well balanced ale.
",5
4546,"Dark amber pour with with a nice dirty white head.  Clove and dark fruit aroma.  The flavor is a jumble of sweet dark fruits and malt with a nice bitterness to it.
",5
4547,"UPDATED: SEP 2, 2008 Beautiful hazy dark amber color with a nice lacing beige head. Moderated aroma of caramell, vanilla and some banana. The taste is less than i expected, but great and balanced. Smooth mouthfeel with a little dry at first, caramel, some toffee and roasted malt a little alcohol and a good, mild bitterness. Liqueric aftertaste.
",5
4548,"11.2 ounce bottle in generic goblet.  Amber/red with lasting ring head.  Brown sugar cherry aroma with faint alcohol.  Brown sugar caramel sweetness with mild raisin fruitiness and lingering sugary sweetness combined with very mild bitterness.  Medium body and carbo.  Not as interesting as I remember, but a very nice mellow flavor.
",5
4549,"UPDATED: FEB 14, 2008 This is ok, but not as interesting as expected.  Its rather fizzy, slightly murky, dark reddish brown.  It has a big light tan head that steadily dissipates to a thin ring and leaves only weak lace.  The aroma is yeast, orange peel, hints of clove and banana, almost like a blend of the aromas of barleywine, Duvel, and a German hefeweizen.  The taste is dry at first but then becomes rather sweet.  Its quite alcoholic from start to finish with a German dark hefeweizen quality along with prunes, dry 7-up, alcohol, whole wheat bread.  The finish is mostly of prunes, alcohol, and a soft hint of whole wheat bread.  It has some similarities to Bush de Noel, but clearly not as strong or pungent, etc.  Its ok, but I dont see much goind on her, its rather boring without being crisp, etc.
",1
4550,"drank at home in a chimay glass. dark cloudy brown, head does not last. slightly sweet. Its worth drinking.
",5
4551,"Had this few times. Always like it but sometimes it was pretty well carbonated. I am not a big Dubbel fan as most brewers do not do a good job. So yeah, it did have some ripe pear flavor with some other flavors but overall, another Dubbel I can do without.
",5
4552,"330ml bottle. Now that I am putting more thought into rating beer I found it did not live up to my expectations/memory. Nice enough, with a quickly dissipating medium head. and a turbid, amber-brown appearance. I found everything middle of the road - fruity with a hint of sweetness and yeast in both aroma and flavor. Medium body and a thin, mildly bitter finish
",5
4553,"The smaller bottle pours murky rich caramel color with about 1/2 inch tan, dissipating head. some lacing. Mild bready aroma with some sweet caramelized sugars. More appreciation for the malts comes with warming. Full flavor. Mild bitterness, almost like  aspirin, with sweet/sour , syrupy aftertaste.
",5
4554,"Poured into a Chimay goblet. Rusty in color with a tan head that leaves excellent Belgian lacing. Aroma is mainly dark esters, with some spiciness. Flavor consists of fig and raisin, with a candied malty undercurrent. Some yeast and phenolic flavors emerge with time. Medium bodied, good carbonation, minimal booziness.

4555,"It had a darkish brown body with desecnt tan head that doesnt last for too long.  It was a delight to drink.
",5
4556,"750 ml bottle ""shared"" with Naka.  Pours amber with fizzy, quickly dissipating head.  Lots of floaters.  Nose of apple and malt, sliht vinegar/sour, some caramel.  Taste is similar, malty caramel and toffee with lots of fruit - apple and cherry.  Alcolol is prevelant in the end and after.  Tasty, readily available, and drinkable.
",5
4557,"33 cl. bottle in chalice, starts off with small soapy looking head that quickly disappears, left behind is a mahogany colored beer with very nice carbonation and a nutty , malty, fruit finish, very good
",5
4558,"Little bottle served at Shay McElroys Irish Pub in Houston.  Poured into a Chimay goblet.  Head appears and disappears quickly.  Its brown.  Lots of different smells and flavors.  I think that there are American versions of this style that are much better.
",1
4559,"Big bottle. A dark amber color with highlights of chocolate. Nice tan head with great retention and carbonation. The aroma is complex with notes of dried apricot, chocolate, spice and earthy character. Some off notes include cardboard which I attribute to oxidation, maybe very old? The taste is a bit dull with some notes of figs, cocoa and spruce. Not bad but not stellar either.
",1
4560,"Pours a brown/dark amber color with a white head.  Has a sweet malty aroma.  Nice sweet taste, a little banana and a little spice, good malt character.  Very good overall.

4561,"UPDATED: JUN 23, 2009 Hazy dark amber/brown. Dense and creamy medium-sized tan head. Pleasant and strong aroma of both sweet and fresh acidulous fruits.

",5
4564,"Pours an opaque ruby-brown color with a big, bubbly white head.  Aroma is earthy and malty... citrus, caramel, hops, and flowers.  Flavor is sugary, bitter with hops, earthy, citrus, alcohol, and it has a bitter lemon aftertaste.		11.2 oz. bottle.

4565,"Aroma of sweet malts and aromatic hops.  Pours reddish brown with an airy head.  Well balanced, complex.  Tastes of cherries, bananas, grapes, and aromatic hops.  Beautiful finish.

4566,"UPDATED: FEB 24, 2008 11.2 oz. bottled poured into a Chimay goblet. Very deep tan head that fell to a thin layer that lasted throughout. Beautiful ruby color, almost opaque.	Aroma is of cherries, burnt sugar - almost like candy, and hints of alcohol.	Cherries and burnt sugar came through in the taste as well, along with other dark fruits - raisin, plum, fig. But also some hoppiness - this is a very complex beer.	Medium bodied, with high carbonation, although not the type that dances on your tongue like some other Trappists.	This is a great beer that really challenges you to find out whats inside - I imagine our oenephilic brethren would have fun with this one.
",5
4567,"Aroma begins with mild noble hops and finishes with grapes, reminiscent of Pinot Noir, heavy fruit.  Pours a woody brown with copper highlights.  The off white head laces fairly.  Flavor is big fruit with early bitterness and the trifecta is completed with  complex malt.  Surprisingly light-bodied and the finish is very dry.  Overall, as complex and fruity as a dry wine, yet the malt and hops add more than you can get from wine alone.  The alcohol sneaks up on you and I keep wanting to soothe my dry tongue, a deadly combination.

4569,"I tried the Blue first and expected this to be a somewhat lesser version of tat.  The Red is a completely different beer, and a good one.  Very nice sweet aroma, and nice lively carbonation.  I actually like this a little more than the Blue.

4570,"This pours darker than the White, but it maintains a similarly smooth flavour and really goes down smooth. A bit less body than other Chimay beers, but it just as clean and satisfying, a very good choice.

4571,"""Chimay Red"" is not just the ""small brother"" of Chimay Blue but has qualities of its own ... it is a tick lighter, frutier (whereas Blue is rather nutty) and doesnt need long storage to get its smoothness ... the color too is lighter (a muddy brown) ... nevertheless, dont be fooled, this is a full bodied brew and a good pairing for stews and soft cheese ....	a truly great beer, worth the Chimay name ... (Chimay Grand Resrve being a legend)
",5
4572,"The pour is a fine reddish brown, with ample creamy head.  The nose is fruits, yeast, nuts and other fine scents.  The flavor is typically Chimay, smooth, slightly floral with hints of citrus.  Another  good beer.

4573,"33cl. Nice colour, medium carbonation. Smells typical but tastes rather flat for a abbey dubbel. Not to compare with westmalle dubbel for sure.

",5
4575,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2008 Brownish red colored beer with nice bubbly/creamy head. Very nice balanced sweet aroma of hops, malts and yeast. One doesnt overwhelm the others. I can tell the carbonation is high which is a signature of Chimay. Head dissipates rather quickly. Very smooth, medium bodied beer with floral hints and light touch of bitterness. Very good overall...better than I thought it would be.
",5
4576,"Cork popped on its own, and lost some fizz in my unpreparedness.  This beer is totally enjoyable, but it was the last of every U.S.-available trappist that I tried, so of course I had haunting memories of Rochefort 10 and 8, Westmalle and Orval.  I would certainly prefer those.

",5
4583,"It poured a nice, big bubbly head that ultimately disappeared, and it was a nice golden amber.  It smelled wonderful with raisins, malts, and a nice hops coming through.  It just tasted overwhelmingly flat though.  It starts with very fruity malts and finishes with alcohol and hops.  On the palate, it was merely thin.
",5
4584,"UPDATED: FEB 26, 2008 Poured a deep copper color.  Aroma is malt and nuts.  Flavor is slightly fruity and sweet, but the finish turns more towards bitter.  A good solid beer, but Chimay Blue is better.

4585,"Clear brown body topped off with a small tan head. There is a very apply aroma mixed with malt. The flavor is a nice balanced malt flavor with floral notes and a bit of citrus and sweetness.

4587,"330ml bottle.  Pours a clear copper brown color with excellent carbonation and a good brownish head.  Aroma is earthy and sweet, with a crisp hoppy scent of grapefruit and apricot along with a yeasty earthiness.  Taste is creamy and medium-bodied with a crisp fruity opening giving way to a tart hoppy finish.  Not quite in the same class as the other Chimays, but still a well done beer.
",5
4588,"Deep brown and coffee-like, this Chimay doesnt have, at least in my opinion, the range or the depth of the other Chimay beers. Its flavor tends more towards sweet and watery with a nutty, almost bitter finish. While certainly not a bad beer, just not what Ive become accustomed to from the Chimay line.
",5
4589,"Poured a light, unfiltered copper.  This brew was a mix between traditional Belgian and champagne (a bit dry).  We wanted to drink it for New Years, but there was too much other liquor to fill the cup.  Very good.
",5
4590,"UPDATED: AUG 14, 2008 A really beautiful beer. This may be perceived as the lowly brother of the 3 in the Chimay family but I find it fabulous. I would describe this much like my Chimay Blue review but with a snappier, more aggressive spice. Like the eager businessman who doesnt realize he can still win the deal without being so in-your-face. Chimay Red has such a lightness in the drinkability yet so much flavor. Simply great.

Flavors are really complex blend of malt, yeast, caramel, dried fruits (dates, raisins), citrus (orange, lemon), some spiciness, and a hint of hops in the finish .To me this is a good Dubbel and a great accompaniment to my meal of American Chop Suey if I dont say so myself

4602,"The commercial description of this is pretty right on. Popped the cork on the bomber bottle as part of New Years Eve celebration. Poured a cloudy light brown with an orangish tint. Had a tall thick foamy head that settled slowly. Nice malty aroma and a creamy carbonated feel. A crisp initial mild bite, but also slighly sweet and hoppy a nice mix of flavors. Mild alcohol taste with a nice complex finish.

4603,"Bottle.  Fluffy white head, dark red color, almost dark tea color.  Sweet smell light wheat and fruit notes.  Fast beginning with small wheat flavor.  Quick fizzy middle with wheat, fruits, and sweetness.  Sharp dry aftertaste with silght alcohol flavor.  Very goob balance between sweetness, bitterness, fruits, & wheat, not overpowering but could use more.

4607,"pours copper.  Nice cream colored head that thins somewhat but does stay.  Does seem to have an aroma of apricots.  Medium mouthfeel.  Nicely caronated.  Tastes of malt sweetness with medium bitter with slight sour finish.  To be honest, my sample was from a store that didnt refrigerate the beer.  Who knows how long it had been sitting on a shelf.  Im sure if I had it in Belguim, Id rate it much higher.

4608,"Large bottle - Amber brown/red colour, tiny head, aroma of dark fruit and malt, flavour of malt and spices yet a hint of sourness, not a bad beer but I prefer the rest of the range
",5
4609,"Bottle. Plenty of fruity esters in the aroma. Bananas in 2% milk topped with sugar. Dry grassy yeast. Pours dark, hazy orange with a fizzy white head. Flavor is pleasant with a lot of yeast. Quite dusty. Some figs and raisins but the yeast component is big. Medium to full bodied with mouth filling carbonation. Oh... to find a Dubbel that I like.
",5
4610,"lovely. Very palatable, lovely aftertaste. Aroma smells of pubs and wormwood scrubs and too many scouser beatings. (I swear on my life, I wrote that first and then the tune came on, the cosmic ballet continues) Another hideously drunk rate but this is tasting damn good. My favourite Chimay? So far, tops the tripel anyway. Really really nice. Remember to buy this.

4612,"12 oz bottle.  Pours an amber red with light, off-white foamy head.  Smells of sweet caramel malts and fruit.  Has an extremely malty flavor with very little bitterness.  It has a dry finish with slight notes of alcohol.
",5
4613,"100th review: 33cl bottle. This pours a beautiful deep and hazy burgundy colour with a very full, thick and rocky off-white head that holds its weight rather well. Appealing dry fruity aromas are on the nose from the get-go, coming across nicely even through its colossal head. Once the dust has cleared (or head in this case) the apricot becomes decidedly more apparent with the hint of banana too. This is exceedingly smooth on the palate from beginning to end. The carbonation is apparent, but not excessive allowing its soft textures to be appreciated. The flavours are fruity -but not as dry as the aroma - with notes of toffee and the alcohol makes itself known but not in a bad way. It certainly went down a treat with me.

4614,"Chimay red cap is full-bodied and slightly sweet with a hint of berries and also has one of the best aftertastes of any beer to be found!

4616,"UPDATED: DEC 18, 2007 Does anyone else find the ubiquity of this ""Trappist"" ale a bit disconcerting?	How many barrels can they make of this stuff and retain quality?  Huge explosion in the kitchen when my wife opened this, attacking one of our guests with the cork during a dinner party.  Huge carbonation, prune scent, a bit sweeter than I had expected.  Wonderful yeasty funkiness, as expected. Dessert.

4617,"Bottle. A beutiful dark brown color. It has a light aroma of fruit and a good head. It has a slight aroma of hop bitternes. It is very drinkable but somewhat boring. If I could choose between this and Chimay Blue I would never drink Chimay Red.
",5
4618,"0.75l bottle. Opening it scared the hell out of my cats :)		Pours a dark brown, with a frothy, but not thick, head that dissipates slowly. Looks really nice, and is asking to be consumed. Smells really nice - mixture of malt, caramel and fruit, mainly banana. Tastes very strong, with notions of malt, fruit and yeast. Sometimes sweet, sometimes bitter. Palate is very smooth, and leaves a tingling feeling on the tongue.
",5
4619,"Gift pack from LCBO, second one tried. Pours murky brown, with a medium sized tan head. Aroma is mostly fruity with some spice and malt. Flavour is what youd expect; fruity, sweet and quite smooth.
",5
4620,"Just because it is popular and readily-available doesnt mean it isnt a great beer! Chimay Red is a classic, flavorful Belgian that every beer drinker needs to try (several times if possible). Fruity, sweet and malty, Chimay makes a nice introduction for new Belgian drinkers due to its easy-to-drink character. Smooth, delicious, and suitably complex, it is a great standby Belgian.
",5
4621,"Purchased this beer from the Auberge de Poteaupre, and enjoyed it in my Chimay glass.  This is truly a great looking beer in the glass: deep red with the lacey white head.  There is a light touch of bitterness in the taste, but it does pour down smooth.  The only real drawback is that the flavor is a little thin.  After the blue, this is the second best Chimay beer.  Fantastic.  Cheers.
",5
4622,"8/12 0.33 l bottle at Hopdevil. Poured bit murky, dark reddish brown body with medium reddish head. Aroma is very nice, caramel with dark fruits, quite yeasty and kind of specific from Trappist beers with sourish character. Flavor is almost as good, following the aroma, being somehow bittersweet now. Could have been a bit fuller regarding body. Nice long sweet fruity finish.  Delicious, simply the best dubbel Ive ever had.
",5
4623,"Great appearance and aroma...  Dark brown, thick white head...  aroma of wine and ripe apples...  Flavor is initially very metallic for some reason...  very light carbonation.  Yeasty wine notes on the back end.

4624,"I just absolutely love this one.  The fruity aroma with the hefty flavor makes Chimay a true delicacy. I still perfer the white, but I wont turn this down.
",5
4625,"UPDATED: FEB 23, 2008 Dark brown beer with big white head. Aroma is sweet and there are plenty of dried fruits. There are not so much typical trappists spyciness than you could be expect. Palate is surprisingly light and medium carbonation makes this very easy to drink. There is enough to complexity to makes this interesting but it is not too complicated to enjoy.

4626,"750ml Bottle:  Aroma of dark fruits, raisins, dough, yeast, malts, and spice.  Poured copper/burgundy/orange in color with a large, foamy, rocky, beige head that lasted throughout.  Clear.  Very sparkling.  A few large particles.  Sweet, metallic flavor.  Tastes of dark fruits, raisins, yeast, and hops.  Medium body.  Tingly texture.  Lively carbonation.  Metallic, hoppy, raisin finish.

4627,"33 cl bottle purchased in a gift pack at Spirits RB. Pours a murky brown with light carbonation and lots of floating yeast with a huge frothy off white head. Aroma of yeast, grain, slight sugar and over ripe banana. Full bodied with a creamy feel that finishes extra dry. Flavor is sort of alet down with an initial metallic flavor that passes.The rest of the flavor seems to be grains and fruit but I am distracted bt the overall dryness of this beer. If your going with Chimay stick with the blue!!
",5
4628,"UPDATED: JAN 3, 2008 330ml bottle.	Hazy to cloudy mahogony, thick creamy persistent head. Sweet fruity and roasty malty aroma. Sharply winey, slightly alcoholic, but massively malty taste. So lovely I could drink this until I fall over.

4629,"Bottle: Another great beer from Chimay.  Pours amber with a huge head.  Aroma of yeast and flavor of same.  Great beer.
",5
4630,"I had heard a lot about this, of course, and I got a  small bottle at a local restaurant. Im not wild about the design of the bottle & label, but the label at least is distinctive. The beer poured with a pretty nice, foamy head, but unfortunately a lot of it slopped over on to the bar. The thick body was a very dark reddish brown. The aroma was excellent: sweet, fruity, and yeasty, with (to my nose) a faint touch of apple. Taste was a richly complex sweet and sour mix, surpisingly mild but with just the right amount of hops to give it bite. It took some getting used to, but grew on me quickly. Its smooth, too, no foul tail at all. The palate was good also, a bit watery to start with but then you get a real tickle in the throat--and the nose, too. The kick is quite substantial, even in the small bottle, so be prepared. This is really a fine beer, though the price will probably keep me from getting it too often. Lovely stuff.
",5
4631,"Bottle 33 cl. Pours a clear red with a medium white head and citrus ad ripe prunes in the nose. The aroma is really fruity too, with a bit of brown sugar and roasted malts and a hoppy, but sweet finish. Pretty good, but I like the blue one better

4632,"Very reddish brown color with slightly off-white head.  Very fruity and rich smell.  Sweet fruitful flavor.  Very nice aftertaste. Probably my favorite beer Ive tried to date.
",5
4633,"(330 ml bottle from <A HREF=http://www.ratebeer.com/Place/maine/augusta/l target=blank>Lous Beverage Barn, cellared for 10 mos. after purchase) Pours cloudy, rust-tinted reddish brown with one finger of tight, level khaki head. Aroma of yeast, red wine, candy, dark fruit, raisins, hints of brown sugar. Mouthfeel soft, with fine carbonation, smooth. Fine, weepy rings of lacing. Flavor is mostly about light red wine and yeast. Light brown sugar and candyish malt. Not a mind-blower but quite nice. More depth and complexity in aroma than in flavor.
",5
4634,"Let me start out by saying that when I first had Chimay Red about 10 years ago, it was the worst beer I had ever had. I had never had a beer before or since that was worse than that first Chimay Red. Now, ten years later, and a more ""sophisticated"" beer drinker, it was time to give it another shot. And the result.....its a pretty good beer. The aroma isnt much, as it is slightly fruity and yeasty. It is a great looking beer, as it poured a cloudy amber color with a nice off-white head. It has a nice full mouthfeel. Flavor is sweet with a nice caramel, brown sugar, and fruity flavor to it. Not one of my favorite beers, but a much better beer than I thought itd be.
",5
4635,"Pours a deep ruby red to brownish sort of color with a creamy off white head.  Nose is spicy, and you can detect light amounts of alcohol, and maybe a tiny bit of roastiness.  It has a nice malt backing and is a little bit bitter upfront with some light fruit flavors.  Finish is very sweet and just a tiny little bit spicy.  Very thick and creamy in the mouth with nice low carbonation.
",5
4636,"Pours light mahogany with frothy white head.  Aroma of caramel, yeast, slight spiciness and dried fruit.  Well-rounded but subdued flavor of caramel malt, yeast, and light fruit.  Slightly dry palate.  A little underwhelming.

4637,"wow nice ruby amber color with a small head.  nice dried fruit smell with some malts mixed in.  very thin despite the darker color on the pour.
",5
4638,"Bottle pours a beautiful brown with a think head. The nose has yeasty caramel, vanilla, an array of malt notes, and spiced fruit. The body is creamy. The flavors starts with sweet malt, which turns bitter quickly and fades slowly. To me, the nose is more appealing than the actual flavor, but this is a nice introduction to a trappist/dubbel.

4639,"Bottle: quite malty, some raisin and dried fruits like sweetness, some bready and yeasty notes, weak bitterness, a bit thin body, pretty dry finish, overall  pretty good but i had better.
",5
4640,"UPDATED: NOV 23, 2007 Smooth, with a touch of caramel but extraordinarily thin. I tasted this peculiar beer after a Leffe Brune. I much prefer the Leffe. Pleasant enough but bland. All the Chimays seem overrated.
",1
4641,"UPDATED: JAN 11, 2009 Re-Rate:	Pours with a light brown, thick head with decent retention and lots of thick lacing. Opaque, red-tinged brown body. Aroma of pitted fruits (dark and light), some yeastiness, some spiciness, and vanilla. Taste is a bit metallicy/astringent, with some dark fruits. Creamy mouthfeel, nice carbonation.		                    	A pleasant looking and smelling ale. Looks, aroma and price slightly better than the Grand Reserve (Blue), but if you can find a bottle of the Grand Reserve, go for that, you can thank me later!

4642,"Tasted on 07-05-07 at 65 F in my trappist glass. Pours a nice opaque ruby brown with a 1 finger off white head that fades quickly. Light hops, malt, a hint of grapes, cherry, and a bit of oakiness to the nose. Taste is of cherry, grapes, and oak. Aftertaste of malt, dry yeast, wheat, and buble gum. A watery-medium body with a bit of a fizzy feel. This basically feels like a watered down version of Chimay Blue. Its alright, but not something I would search for.
",5
4643,"Kind of like walking the Johny Walker trail of colorified increasing better tasting beverages, the Chimay Rouge falls between the white and blue in my book.
",5
4644,"Deep red-brown color. High carbonation led to huge head. Dissipated quickly. Very delicate aroma. Mild sweetness. Flavor is lite and clean w/ subtle chocolate. High carbonation is annoying. Otherwise, decent beer; nothing too exciting.
",1
4645,"750ml bottle.  pours a muddy prune hue, with a very dubbel style head.  fruity aromas dominate - the obvioius apricot, also subtle pear, caramelized white grapes, orange peel, and a bit of coriander, and a distinct aroma of chocolate covered raisins.  the taste begins exceptionally smooth, almost like silk on the palate.  then the lighter malts and a healthy dose of yeast shines through mid-way, also revealing a punch of carbonation.  that apricot aroma bleeds into the finish, but the taste - overall - is surprisingly a little shallow.  the finish also has a touch of hop, but just nothing overwhelmingly impressive.  nonetheless, its well crafted, and its one to enjoy.  i will revisit this one.
",5
4646,"Received this as part of a Chimay gift pack that included Chimary Red, Blue and Tripel.  Pours a deep nut brown wit a beige foamy head that persists for a while.   The beer has creamy texture with a medium long finish.  Overall, a full and tasty beer.
",5
4647,"Drank from a goblet. Dark orange, hazy, with sediment in it almost like a suspension liquid. Malty, roasted caramel with a slightly acidic, flowery tinge. (The first time I had this one, I swear I tasted eggnog in it, but not anytime since). 		I love the look of this beer in a glass, and I like the thickish mouthfeel.
",5
4648,"This Beer tastes like soap to me. Its got some nice malty flavor, but its got this sharp nasty bitter flavor that stays in my mouth. Not my thing.
",1
4649,"Pours a cloudy brown / copper with a thin head. Aroma of fermented fruits, malt, yeasts and spice. Flavor is light sweet fruits, tartish malts and touches of spice. Body was sort of thin but overall it was enjoyable but nothing special.
",5
4650,"It has been a long time since Ive had this one and noticed I hadnt rated it.  So I got a bottle looking to revisit an old favorite, but then was very underwhelmed by what I had.  Poured dark amber with a tan head.  The aroma has earthy caramel malt, Belgium yeast and light richness.  Medium / thin body with fairly sharp carbonation.  The taste starts with some astringency, light toffee, dry caramel and a bit of phenolic spice.  The finish is short and spicy.  An okay beer, but this came across as far from being a world class Trappist ale.  Hopefully i have a better experience with this and can add a more favorable rerate down the road.
",5
4651,"Bottle.  Pours a deep red-brown.  Off white head that dissipates rather quickly, leaving little lacing. The aroma is of dark fruits, plums, and cherry, caramel malts, a bit of citrus, some fruity hops.  Flavor is much the same as the smell, with a bitterness from the hops coming through in the end.  Dry and very sweet plum finish that lingers.  The feeling is bubbly and leaves the tongue tingling.  Overall not bad, but great either.
",1
4652,"Pours dark brown with off white head. Aroma has nice fruit and sweetness. Flavor hasthe fruit but also a bitterness in the finish.
",5
4653,"Had this beer on 3/6/2007.  Color is a hazy brown with good carbonation and a nice tight head.  Aroma is a sour malty scent.  Taste is mild and fruity.  Starting a medium body it goes down with a fizzy feel.  Finish comes on with a light malt flavor that seems a bit sweet but has nice sour tones that come out on the end, then finishes with a mild fruity yeast flavor and a light bitterness.  In the end it leaves you clean and felling refreshed.  Its much lighter then the Blue and a much more refreshing beer then you would expect.  If it wasnt so expensive it would be a great beer to have everyday.
",5
4654,"Pours deep nut brown with a quickly settling head. Aroma is quite yeasty, with citrus and almonds. The flavour is of yeast and slightly fruity malts and almonds - the malts somehow seem to mesh into one slightly off flavour. Not very impressive. Wasnt a huge fan of their white either.
",1
4655,"bottle.  fizzy khaki colored (quickly dissapating) head into murky blackish-red body.  decent lacing.  some ripe fruits (cherries and berries mostly), yeast and malts were all noticed in the aroma.  flavor is sweet with light bitterness in finish.  fizzy carbonation.  no suprise to anyone this one is good but not as good as the blue.
",5
4656,"IMO, the best of the three Chimays (Red, White, Blue).  This beer has a lot of different characteristics to like:  its lightly fruity, theres a bit of roastiness, and it is also a bit spicey (clove or coriander or both).  Easily the most complex of the three, and to me, the most likable.		Appearance is a nice red-brown, which is not quite opaque.  Head formation is decent, whitish, of uniformly sized bubbles, and sticks around an average amount of time.  Aroma is of dried fruit, and a bit of spice.  Flavor is more of the same, but adds a layer of light roastiness.  The fruitiness exists in a dried fruit sense, but also exerts itself as lightly sour (like sour cherries).  Mouthfeel was a bit astringent and drying, which youd expect from a beer with roasty and sour characteristics.  I really liked this beer.		Ive had this in restaurants before (all the Chimays seem like theyre popping in fine-dining places everywhere), and it is usually served much too cold.  This beer really seems to shine at about 50-55 degrees.		Definitely recommended.

4657,"Unfiltered dark ruby pour with medium head. Pleasant aroma of yeast, floral and mild sweetness. Taste is of strong spice with some notes of raisins. Finishes only noticeably bitter with a light alcohol note. Although not thick, it has a way of almost numbing your mouth for a second. Very unique in that way.
",5
4658,"Pours a cloudy reddish-brown with a small, creamy, tan head that diminishes to a thin skin at the surface; patchy lace and nice legs. The nose is brown sugar, raisins, prunes, vanilla, fruity yeast and alcohol. Medium-bodied with lively carbonation and a lightly astringent finish. Fruity and yeasty with notes of prunes, woody red wine and spice, the flavor concludes with a lingering blend of all the above and a light alcohol note at the finish. A very satisfying brew with a superior blend of nicely integrated flavors.

4659,"Aroma of toffee and caramel.  Smooth, thin, caramelly mouthfeel with some burnt toffee in the finish.  Has some faint suggestions of toast as well.
",5
4660,"750ml Bottle. Pours a dark red with a nice fizzy beige head. The taste is a light fruit, hops, and good bit of yeast. It seems a bit dry sometimes, especially after awhile on the shelf. A light and easygoing drink, but really good. Much like a good wine.
",5
4661,"Rated blind from ""Better Know a Style: Abbey Dubbel"" tasting.   Dark brown, hazy, fizzy off-white head.  Light aroma but mild grape.  Slight fruit flavor, brown sugar, so very light.  Thin and watery.  Unappealing in flavor and aroma and thin.

4662,"750ml. cork says 2006. hazy reddish brown...almost the color of the bottle. aromas of chocolate, bread grain, citrus and metallic malts. flavor is caramel, earth, yeast, cocoa and something citrusy. medium mouth feel with high carbonation. dry, lightly bitter finish with a raisin/chardonnay like aftertaste.

4663,"Some raters have reviewed the Chimay Red better than I can, so Il leave you with some quotes like ""Chimay essentially should never be taken for granted, no matter how often you walk down the supermarket aisles and see it sitting there."" Cheers! :-)

4664,"bottle.  brown pour with clarity.  foamy off white head.  light dark fruit, mild cherry, oak, deep malty aroma.  smooth and mellow.  well balanced.  malt body is nutty and rich.  enjoyable.
",5
4665,"330. Pours grainy, essentially opaque dark, dark brown. Thick, sudsy tan head that falls away, leaving a little bit of intermittent spotty lace. Nice nutty, caramelly, husky nose--much more cerealy and American than I remembered. Medium body, soft and tight carb. Sweet brown sugar and brown bread kicks off the mid-palate and holds sway til the end. Very nice rich autumnal/wintry food beer for roasty, gamey business aplate. Chimay essentially should never be taken for granted, no matter how often you walk down the supermarket aisles and see it sitting there. Great stuff. Never get tired of it.
",5
4666,"Pour is a dark red with a large white head.  Aroma is some dark fruits but not much else.  Flavor is malty and again dark fruit but nothing again stands out.  None of the usual yeastyness that i would usually get with a Belgian.  For being one of the six trappist brews this is one kinda of bland and boring.

4667,"Strong floral aroma with plenty of hops... dark copper colored ale pours with a thick white head... tastes refreshing with plenty of hops ... very smooth texture that lingers in the mouth...
",5
4668,"11.2oz bottle.  Aroma is yeast, sweet malts. Large off-white head that mostly diminished and left little lace.  Deep dark murky brown amber hue with lots of small particles.  Flavor is malty and yeasty but not as much as the white.  Medium bodied and lively.  Another crappy chimay.  Best to never buy them again.
",1
4669,"UPDATED: MAY 24, 2009 Probably the best drinking beer Ive had.  Nice deep copper hue with a nice toasted head.  Fantastic aroma full of malt, fruit, and a tiny hint of hops.  Flavor profile is as stated in the Brand Description, fruited notes with little of the alcohol coming through at all, and as any good Belgian, the yeast plays a big part in the flavor profile.  The palate is fine, nice mouth feel.  Overall this isnt as complex as its big brother the Blue label/Grande Reserve, but I enjoyed it a bit more.  This would also make a very flexible beer when pairing with food.
",5
4670,"75cl Bottle.  Id say it was about 12 years ago that I first had this, it is responsible for popping my Belgian beer cherry at the ripe age of 18.  Light murky brown in color with off white foam, decent lacing and retention.  Aroma is slightly phenolic with notes of yeast and some maltiness.  Rich malty flavor with a somewhat bitter finish for the style.  Gets higher marks than it should due to nostalgia and Im ok with that.
",5
4671,"bottle- ruby red in appearence, with a tan head. raisins, grapes, dark sour cherries dominate, with less of a profound finish than most belgiums. I prefered this to Blue, but was not wowed overall.

4672,"Nose of raisins, bready and yeast, Mouthfeel is much lighter than the blue or white versions. Tatse is somewhat flatter and lacks the intensity of the other two. Dates and raisins on the tongue. Nice but not great.
",5
4673,"UPDATED: JUL 21, 2008 11.2oz bottle. About time I rated this beer. Aroma is raisins, prunes, red wine, vanilla, yeast, hints of earthiness, some brightness. Served @ 61 in a Chimay chalice. Pretty dark copper, nearly brown color with a two fingered head a top. The Chimay glass allows me to pour the entire beer into the glass, dregs and all. Taste is huge malt, dark fruits, vanilla, some tartness/acidity, and some warming alcohol. Nice mouthfeel, seems full and not just from the carbonation, but easy to drink. The finish is lingering dates, cinnamon, some earthy hops and some moderate bitterness and alcohol presence. I remember being perplexed and amazed the first time I had the beer and for a good reason; A classic.

4677,"75 cl bottle.  Poured with a large off-white head.  The color was a dark and cloudy ruby; very opaque with just a little orange/brown color.  The aroma is light--definite apricot and some yeast too.  The taste is remarkable.  The fruit taste isnt too intense.  The palate of this beer is so pleasant that the taste is secondary.  The flavor is light spice and some fruit.  The finish is smooth and malty.  I could have this stuff for dinner.  This is my first Chimay and I cannot wait to taste the rest.

4682,"33cl. bottle from a local beer retailer. It pours a murky brown liquid with some amber tones (and some ruby as it evolves) and many little yeast spots, with a gigantic consistent and pillowy beige head (tainted brown by a nice yeast sediment) that lasts beautifully throughout the beer and leaves some good lacing. The aroma is mostly malty, with caramel, brown sugar, some hints of banana and a slight citrusy hoppiness. There is also a good deal of roastiness and bready yeasts. It tastes kind of likewise, but intenser and more complex, some dried fruits suddenly appearing as well as a faint brandy-like touch. A nice spiciness is also there. It is medium sweet, a little sour and has a pleasant notable bitterness. In the mouth it feels thick and mildly carbonated, with little bubbles coming alive inside the mouth, very slightly prickling the tongue. The body is medium, giving the brew more drinkability. It finishes rather dry and bitter, with a sweet caramelly and nutty finish along with some floral and citrusy hoppiness. The presentation is smart and very trappist-like. I love it; cant help it. It might be somewhat overrated (not much, though), but the feelings towards some beers go beyond the metrics. A nice way to celebrate my 200 ratings.

4687,"UPDATED: MAR 24, 2009 All I have to say is wow. My first Chimay. This Belgium beer is by far one of my favorites now. A strong fruity aroma that is a medium red and little to no head. This brew tingled, but was smooth and had just enough bitterness to let you know you were drinking a beer.

4690,"This is the standard dubbel I pretty much started my Belgian ale tasting career on. Available at just about any liquor store with a good beer selection. Not much to say here that hasnt already been said about its character. A decent brew with good a good rich fruit nose on the flavor and a soft palate, however there are many Belgians out there much more worth seeking than this.

4691,"Light brown in color.  Sediment on bottom that I was carful not to pour.  Nice and refreshing aroma of peaches.  Caramel in the body and alcohol.  Nice.

4693,"UPDATED: OCT 28, 2007 11 ounce bottle purchased at The Fresh Market Pembroke Pines, FL.. Very good
",5
4694,"UPDATED: NOV 5, 2007 Bottle conditioned and courtesy of the LCBO. Shared with the wife. Drank before the Chimay White so I could compare these two styles from the monastery. Poured a dark bronze colour, with a very foamy off-white head. Gives off a rich fruity aroma, full of mulling spices. Initial taste was a little metallic, and I think this is beecause I served it a little too cold. As the beer warmed the aroma intensified, and started to exhibit its characeterisics very pleasantly in the flavour. The carbonation was nice on the tongue, and helped tone down some of the sweetness from the malt. A classic beer.
",5
4695,"33 cl bottle - Pours a hazy light brown color with a big two finger thick off white head.  Since my nose is stuffed up do to allergies, I can only detect the esters.  Flavor is also fruity.  Palate is smooth.  Medium body.  A nice beer.
",5
4696,"Rating of this Red based on 04-2000 bottle. Have had newer bottles and enjoy them. As much as this one is not supposed to be aged I stumbled upon this one. Body is still nice. Reddish brown cloudy body color. Nice head retains well. Nice aroma, sweet, more mild than a new bottle. Smooth flavor, prefer unaged Red.
",5
4697,"Cloudy light-brown body with a long-lasting small beige head.  Fruity yeast notes of raisins on the nose.  Taste is all about the fruity yeast.  Prunes, raisins and grapes are the main fruity flavours.  The sweet malt-base feels more like maple sap than caramel.  Despite being very very fruity with grapes upfront the beer never gets vinous.  Fruity finish, a quick bitterness at the end is not enough to really pierce the fruity taste.  Very active carbonation with a little minerals touch.  Very good beer although this type of classic fruity Belgian ales is an over-crowded genre.  Classic.  My least favourite of the excellent Chimay line-up.  Always nice to go back to an old love as Orval and Chimay are two of the beers that turned me into good beers.  I was drinking Chimay back in the early 1990s.  Things were very different back then, there was a crazy G.W. Bush as president of the USA fighting a meaningless war in the middle east nevermind.

4698,"Red in color, fruity peach or apricot aroma, tastes a little of spices, malty, not to sweet. Important that the proper glassware is used when drinking this beer.

4699,"bottlle into glass.  Beautiful red color in glass with nice head and lacing.  Delicous aroma of peaches almost too ripe.  The aroma and flavor became more intense as the beer sat for about 10 minutes in the glass. Alcohol seems to be hidden a little better in this beer than in the white. Great beer.
",5
4700,"Strong fruity, almost wine like aroma.  Some alcohol in the nose as well.  Very pleasant.  A reddish golden brown.  Small tan head that quickly dissipates.  Very malty, not too sweet, nice and clean in the finish with slight alcohol.  Some creaminess as it warms, perhaps some spices as well.  Mouthfeel is very bubbly and carbonated.  Nice and full.

",5
4704,"Tasty dubbel. Reddish brown in colour. Fruity smell, Yeasty, fruity chocolaty taste. Not too diffrent from Chimay Blue but not quite as nice.
",5
4705,"Light stone fruit aroma, like ripe apricot or freestone peach. The color is ripe apricot flesh. The beige head flattened and ringed. Medium bodied; slightly coarse, nearly creamy, carbonation; somewhat chewy. The flavor is light stone fruit, red berries, a sour note, a very little caramel sweetness, fresh plum, an astringency calling wood to mind. The finish is quite dry, and there is a very small bitter aspect. Very nice. The mouth puckers and begs for more.
",5
4706,"Very interesting. This beer makes any beer drinkers perfect stand-in for any decent white wine. An opaque amber off the pour with one-half to an inch of pale tan head, the aroma is definitely beerish, with yeast being the most apparent, followed by hops. However, the taste is of citrus, summer berries, and plum with smooth malt undertones, followed by a fairly strong, wine-like alcoholic kick.
",5
4707,"One of my very favorite beers. Beautiful red color, not much of a head. Complex aroma reminiscent of dark fruits, somewhat peppery. Flavor is the same, malty, tremendous estery character provided by the Chimay yeasts. Hop flavor barely evident, the malts and candi sugar dominate.

4711,"Pours a deep auburn color with a off-white rocky head.  Flavor is sweet fruit and nuttiness with some light hops.  A nice smooth, dry  and slightly bitter finish.  Very good dubbel.
",5
4712,"Pours a hazy red/brown, with an initially giant head that is mostly white. Fruity smell methinks. Somewhat sweet, caramel and raisins are abound. Somewhat bitter and leaves the drinker with a sort of dry and champagne aftertaste. There is a sort of apple/pear taste in it as well. Not sure which one actually. Pretty sugary, a pretty good slow drinker I would say.

",5
4714,"UPDATED: JUN 6, 2009 750ml bottle. Pours a nice burgundy colour with a large beige head, and lots of carbonation. Aromas are indistinct, but mostly yeasty, esterly. The flavour is nicely complex, very sweet, notes of caramalts for sure, some raisins, almost some bready malts in there which I did not expect at all! It gives way to a dull bite mid-palate, which to me seems like the only detectable presence of hops and alcohol. Very smooth on the palate, other than the finish, which is long. Some ripe, almost fresh tasting fruit flavours are evident in the finish and aftertaste, apricot, pear, as well as the added sugar and yeast. Not bad, my first Dubbel, I trying to get more into Belgians so this was a good experience for me.

4715,"750 mL bottle from LCBO, served cold in a tulip glass as a reward for painting my livingroom.	App.:  Deep brownish-ruby, clear for now, rocky off-white head.	  	Aroma:  Huge gobs of brown sugar, caramel and treacle, lightly vinous with plenty of dark dried fruits, a moderate dose of yeast, a little burnt sugar and a bit of musty hops.	  	Palate:  Medium-full body, medium effervescence.	  	Flav.:  Light apricot, followed by a wave of malt-like flavours from the nose, a touch of cardboard and light hops; a little woody and alcoholic to finish; very restrained bitterness; feels almost refreshing.		Its lovely stuff.  Glad I have a big bottle.
",5
4716,"UPDATED: JAN 4, 2010 From a 33cl bottle on august 26, 07 at a Botulfs in Lund.   Aroma is floral and citrusy with a touch of alcohol.   Rich cloudy redish brown color with a thin off-white head that dissipates quickly.   Flavour is well balanced with caramel malt dominating and the high alcohol showing slightly with the hop notes in the aftertaste.  Palate is rich with lively carbonation that sticks around as the beer warms.   Overall, a good beer-the best that ive had in Sweden so far.   This is my first Abbey Dubbel and if it is typical of the style, then i am looking forward to trying more.   I would have liked slightly more hop bite to balance the richness of the malt, but it worked all the same. (6,4,7,4,16)	Rerate: 33cl bottle.   Its been over two years, but Im finally getting around to rerating my first beer on the site.   Back then I had no idea what a dubbel was supposed to taste like, I just knew that I thought this was a pretty good beer and it sparked my interest in Belgian beer and the Trappists in particular.   I have certainly come along way since then, rating 22 other dubbels in the mean time.   I am certainly not as impresses with Rouge now as I was then, but it is still a decent beer.   The flavor seems a little too thin and devoid of malt character, with an almost washed-out yeast profile, but it still hangs on to a nice balance and some dried fruit flavors including apricot and prune, with a lightly spicy edge.   The aroma is a touch yeasty and doughy with some clove, cookie and cooked red apple, but lacks the depth and impact of better dubbels.   Light bodied and a little airy with carbonation that could be tighter and creamier.   If it sounds like Im just hating at this point, its only because I once built this beer up so much; I still dont dislike it, it just really isnt anything special once youve been around the block a few times.

4717,"This ones a bit hard as I expected a lot from it. Initially poured too cold, sweet and malty nose. Champagne head and mouthfeel. Sugary cola flavor. Surprisingly it got worse when it got warmer. It went stale very quickly, loosing all carb and flavor was like thin coffee. Quite thin and light overall, which was a surprise. I pretty sure Il try this again.

4721,"Pours a reddish brown in color with only a slight head.  Smell is somewhat laced with spices.  Maybe some clove and a real faint cinnamon.  Taste is highly carbonated and bubbly.  There is some spice as well as some dark fruit in the taste.  Perhaps just a bit too much carbonation.  Not bad, an easy drinker.
",5
4722,"A very nice Belgian. Poured dark murky brown with fluffy head. Little lacing, though (and why do I really care about that?). Taste was rich and complex...sweet but not overly so (like some Belgian knockoffs). The monks do it right.

4723,"UPDATED: JUL 8, 2008 Dry at first, but is gets more complex the more you drink.  I really like this.  The smell is yeasty.  The color is a beautiful cider-red.  Nice fluffy head that lingers.  Good stuff.  Similar to Westmalle Dubbel, but a little cheaper
",5
4724,"Pours with minimal head into its own chalice. Mild candi sugar and bread yeast in the nose. Mushy, slightly vegetal taste, odd sugars and belgian malts. Yeast is not too distinctive or attractive, for that matter. Fits the style and is moderately enjoyable, but a bit muddled and messy IMO.

4745,"Hazy red/brown pour with generous pillowy head, some lacing on the glass.   Always a fan of the billowing bubbles throuhgout the course of the beer. Bready/yeasty on the nose, with touches of fruits, berry, pear, apricot and sugar.  Smooth and fruity tasty with rounded body and caramel malts.  There is a hoppy-crisp, slightly acidic finish which is a nice touch and provides contrast to the chewy malty body up front.  Overall a nice beer

4746,"Second time i hade this and the same thing happened when i opened the bottle that time; a small fountain of foam that wont stop, maybe my beer got disturbed by this.	Pours a red hazy body with that nice pillar of bubbles rising in the middle thanks to the nicely designed chimay glas, it has an large creamy head.	Aromy is fruita and spicy.	Flavor is fruity and spicy to.	Palate is thick and smooth.

4747,"Murky, reddish brown color with a full frothy head. Lacing all over the glass. Apples, apricot, raisins, yeast with a hint of nuttiness. Slightly floral. Medium body with a crisp, clean finish. As good as the Blue and quite frankly, I really cant tell much in difference.
",5
4748,"One of my favorite all-time beers.  This introduced me to a whole new world outside of San Diego county.  Aroma is dried fruits and apples.  Flavor when properly handled is complex, floral, fruity, raisins, rum, candy, yeasty love.  One of my perennial favorites.
",5
4749,"Out of the bottle, amber with a good head. Aroma was nice but the flavor was rather bland. Il try it again and rerate.

4750,"Your typical abbey dubbel, a dark brown with a thin head.  The aroma is dominated by malt, caramel, and dark fruits.  Taste is mostly dark fruit combined with a slight woody taste, malts, and spices.  A solid, if unspectacular, abbey dubbel.
",5
4751,"UPDATED: NOV 11, 2007 1pt., 9.4 fl bottle. Pours a cloudy unfiltered dark brown with a tan head that vanished surprisingly quick. Aroma was caramel and plums with a hint of spice. Taste was complex with chocolate in the forefront, other flavors--oak, pine, caramel, and walnuts. Mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with a slight fizz. There is an undertone of distinguished non-bitter hops. Finish was long and smooth with a caramel aftertaste. Nice pour for cleaning out the garage.
",5
4752,"Good beer, but nowhere near the Blue.  It has a nice lively feel to it and a good taste, but not as complex as others of the style.  Highly rated, but youre better off with others of the variety.  For example, many from Unibrau are at least as good and cheaper.
",5
4753,"UPDATED: OCT 1, 2007 piacevolissima da bere senza troppo impegno,  sicuramente pi gustosa della Tripel e pi accessibile (e versatile) della Bleue. 	presa in un pub a Gavi, ne ho prese due perch (questa  la scusa ufficiale) la prima volta non mi avevano portato il tappo. Ribevuta oggi dopo un piatto di gramigna al rag fatta in casa.________________ENGLISH TEXT HERE__________________very pleasant to drink, its surely tastier than the tripel and more simple and soft than Blue. Two bottles at a bar in Gavi Ligure; again, at home, after homemade pasta.
",5
4754,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2007 July 5, 2007; 750ml corked bottle. As a big fan of the Bleue variety (Quad), I was underwhelmed by this one -- possibly making an unfair comparison to the former (and more substantial) style.  An exceptional aroma of tart, overripe-fruit presages a burst of similar flavor -- which quickly dissipates to a dry, slightly-watery finish.
",5
4755,"Chimay Premiere is a hazy raspberry brown ale with a mostly-diminishing, splotchy, sand-colored head that leaves good lacing.  It has a tart aroma of straw, cherries, and perhaps dark bread, molasses, herbs, figs, butter, sweat, earth and cheese. It is dry, fizzy and medium bodied; sharp and dry like Champagne.  It is lightly sweet and bitter, moderately acidic and tart.  There is a musty quality that one would expect in a wine.  It is a well-blended and focused flavor thats hard to pick apart.  Great balance!  The aftertaste is clean and lightly bitter with possibly a hint of coriander.  A classic.
",5
4756,"Pours a cloudy, dark reddish brown color with an off white, dingy yellowish quickly diminishing head, and floating yeasty sediment.  Has a fruity, sweet, and sour nose similar to a flemish sour ale. (at least liefman goudenband)  Initial taste strikes me as fairly dry and bland and then opens up into a spiced fruitiness, with a clove-like coriander flavor with an almost dull numbing effect.  This could also be the intense over carbonation that almost strips and dries the tongue.  Overall, quite drinkable for a fairly high alcohol beer, but I not a big fan of the clove spiced flavors in this and in hefeweizens.
",1
4757,"750 ml bottle into a goblet.  Deep scarlet to light brown body with a quickly vanishing white head.  Aroma is intensely fruity with some phenolic notes (clove and other spices).  Taste is equally fruity with some funky earth/spicy notes.  Highly carbonated with a dry, very mild bitter finish.
",5
4758,"Deep brown in color with ruby hues. Huge, fluffy off white head pours three fingers thick. Excellent retention. Sheets of lace cascade down the sides of the glass.  Offensive malts. Rotten fruit. White pepper. Clove. Asprin. Warming alcohol.  Stinky bready malts with caramel undertones are followed by flavors of rancid fruit and a hint of lime citrus juice. Medicinal hops chime in and are drowned out by cloves and a white sour spice on the tongue.  I only had one and the next day my poop was black.
",1
4759,"Deep red color with a pale head that clings to the glass relatively well. There are fruity flavors through the body, but I felt that it was a bit to sweet. That sweetness lent and awkward aftertaste.

4760,"UPDATED: OCT 1, 2007 Bottle 0,33 Cl. Amber color with a persistent beige head. Fruity Aroma, the flavor is bitter and fruity. Mouthfeel is bitter and good		Portugus : Cerveja de cor mbar e espuma bege e persistente. Aroma frutado a sabor entre frutado amargo, bem balanceado. Fica um amargor gostoso na boca.
",5
4761,"Pours a dark, almost opaque brownish amber. Nose of roasted malts, dough, dried fruits. The dried fruits are there in the flavor, too--sweet with a mild hoppy counterpoint. Nice, full mouthfeel. Solid Trappist offering, but not stellar.
",5
4762,"330 mL bottle.  Golden red amber with a big fluffy off-white head.  Aroma of fruit and yeast.  Silky some what sticky paltae.  Light fruity taste, molasses, a hint of brown sugar, and a slightly bitter finish.
",5
4763,"Ruddy brown in color with a thin white head, looks quite effervescent in the glass.  Sweet malt and yeast aromas, some fig-like smells, but subdued.  Nice palate - very light and drinkable.  Rich sweet dark pit fruit tones play around in the taste but never overwhelm.  The finish is a bit dry and kind of simple.  Although I need to try the Blue again, I like this one better.
",5
4764,"75 bottle-Rogue in Rittenhouse Philadelphia. Pours a nice brownish coloring with a slight head (when poured properly) Nice slight spice aroma, stronger than the white/blue. Extremely enjoyable.
",5
4765,"Pourd an opaque murky brown with a hint of copper, head is a creammy soapy tan lasts halfway through the beer. aromas, if that of fruit and lovely yeast more  like wine than beer.  Flavor is INCREDABLE with balanced hop bitterness and a perfect sweetnes, all balanced in a mastered blend of unfiltered bliss,  heavy body,  great mouth feel,  and perfect with my steak,  the ceamy finish lasts and paired well with the rich fatty steak,  I thought I had died and gone to heaven for a minute.  A tru winner if you appreciate REAL beer

",5
4770,"33 cl bottle @ Lasse Autios Herrgrd, Ropns, Vasa. Rated on 27.9.2008	Aroma has some banana, aged fruits, yeast and spices. Flavour is richly grainy and has some sweetish malt. Good dubbel but still I see no reason to buy it again.
",5
4771,"Nice trappist. Considerably better than Chimay Bleue. (This beer rating was imported from FB and unfortunately lacks any further comments.)
",5
4772,"Wow, a very nice dubbel. Aroma is yeasty, bready, light pepper, and light apricots with even lighter banana. Poured a nice red/brown cloudy color with an off white head. The taste was bready, sweet, and malty with light bitterness on the end. The mouth feel was nice and creamy. An excellent trappist dubbel I would recommend to anyone.
",5
4773,"Would have been a much better beer if it wasnt for that darn palate which I suspected to be much heavier since it is one of the only seven Trappist beers. Not at all bad, nice bit of bitterness which is the strongest aspect of the overall week aftertaste. Aroma is great, very fruity and the beer looks nice and red. Good beer but not exactly what I hoped it would be.
",1
4774,"Pours red/brown with a big foaming white head. Nose is yeast, red wine, malt, dried fruit (apricot, pineapple etc) and perfumey floral notes. Taste is tropical dried fruit, brown sugar and creaminess. Really nice and thoroughly well balanced Belgian beer.

4775,"Nice brownish red color with a moderately sized head, tasty beer but not nearly as good as the blue cap.

4776,"75 cl bottle - first time trying Chimay;pours cloudy amber getting more thick by the end; spicy aromas are the strongest; drinks full, smooth and almost creamy texture; malty aftertaste
",5
4777,"Bottle: Pours beautiful clear brown with reddish tinge, like chocolate or an antique copper color, like an old, old penny. The medium head is tan and lingering. Fruity aromas, almost like wine, with assorted fresh bread aromas.	And the taste! Oh, the taste. Marvelous! Wonderous! Sweet, yet not cloying, with a mild astringency and hoppy bitterness, all balancing out in a glorious dance of flavors and textures, no one flavor dominating, all in harmony. Even my mother liked  it, and my mother doesnt like most beer. Rich and full, and finishes nice and clean. 	Nothing negative to say about it, cept I wish I had another one handy!
",5
4778,"Nice fruity and yeasty aroma.  Pours brownish with a small tan head.  Flavor is sweet, but not overly, nicely balanced.  Full bodied, with a dry finish.  Pretty well rounded and nice.
",5
4779,"Clear dark red colour, big white head. Fruity aromas. Sweet and fruity tastes as well. All in all, a nice, affordable beer.
",5
4780,"UPDATED: AUG 9, 2007 One of my favorite Trappist beers. Like other Trappist beers, I wish it wasnt so expensive because I would love to stock up on a few bottles.
",5
4781,"Light slightly dusty aroma. Dark red color with a big white, fluffy head. Semi sweet, a hint of toffee (maybe). No bitterness. Some fruitiness.  Thin with ever so slightly scratchy carbonation. Kinda dries my tongue.
",5
4782,"Rich copper/ red colour with a thick white head. Fruity aroma with hints of spice and pepper. Malty, fruity cherry/plum character with spicy vinious finish.  Good dry/ bitter mouthfeel with a hearty carbonation. A very pleasant beer.
",5
4783,"750 ml... Cloudy dark copper poor with a small beige head.  Aromas of blackberries, raspberries, peaches, apricot, caramelised malts... very fruity floral aromas. Nothing spectacular to the palate, little bitterness, mildly sweet, lively carbonation and medium bodied.  Flavors of caramel, black cherries, plums ... not spectacular but preaty good....
",5
4784,"I recently tried a Chimay for the first time, a 2007 I think of the blue and found it to be miles different from a 2006 I tried later, so I am thinking the same that the bottle of red I tried may have also been a little young. Lots of fizz out of the bottle but seemed to lose the head very quickly indeed and it evaporated to nothing. A great deal of aroma, very fruity and sweet but like the young blue it just seemed to me that it was more fizz on the tongue which seemed to lead onto not a great deal
",1
4785,"Amber color with a big white head. Aromas of prunes, malt, fruits, caramel and yeast. Palate of malt, caramel, toffee, prunes, chocolate and hops.
",5
4786,"Small bottle poured a clear reddish amber with a large lasting amber head. Aromas of carmel, fruittiness and light spice. Palate was light to medium bodied and crisp. Flavors of carmel, light fruit and a hint of spiciness with a crisp lingering malty finish.

4787,"mahogany with a light brown thick head. light fruity aroma. pretty carbonated with medium silky body. fairly bitter with a nice alcohol bite. creamy fruit and a very light taste of spiced nutty caramel malt. nice balance but i think the bitterness is slightly overpowering on the other flavors
",5
4788,"Pours an impressive ruby brown, w/ a nice Belgian head.  Taste is a perfect balance between sweet malts & sugar, and a slight alcohol pucker.  Very well done.
",5
4789,"Dark brown decent head.  Somewhat dry... To me not in the same league as the Rochefort 6.
",5
4790,"Deep, dark copper color with a short lived foamy head. Smooth, fruity overtones with a slightly bitter finish mellowing, again, into a refreshing fruity aftertaste.
",1
4791,"First taste 5/21/07.  Pours translucent and cloudy dark copper with a large head that quickly recedes and some lacing.  Aroma is not very strong.  Taste is somewhat metallic and sharp at first, but softens considerably as the beer warms.  Sweet yeast and malt are offset nicely by a decent amount of bitterness.  Not as impressive as the Bleue or the Blanche, but a fairly solid offering nonetheless.
",5
4792,"a decent dubbel.  some brown sugar and spice to this one with some weak chocolate and some carmel.  a little thin compared to the other chimay beers but not unlikable, just not up to par.
",5
4793,"Good Tripel from a respectable brewer.  I was expecting a little more power and flavor, but it drank smooth, and had tasty hints of lighter fruits. Pours a fluffy tall head.   Nice beer for a hot day.
",1
4794,"33cl. Pours a dark brown beer. Fruity aromas, slightly spicy, yeasty. Reminds me of a very spicy dunkel. The taste makes me think of one too.. But there is a typical taste of plums that gives this beer its character. Caramel, hints of licorice.. Some chocolate in the taste, spicy. The caramel presence isn t all that enoyable... A touch of bitterness in the finish. I wasn  t impressed by this beer. I think its definitely inferior to the Chimay blonde and the Chimay bleu... But still quite consistant.
",1
4795,"12 oz bottle. ..Heavy aroma with toasty and chocolate notes.  Light citusry hoppiness with peppery yeastiness. .. 	Large, off-white fizzy head that lasts. ..	Moderately sweet and slightly bitter. Long and complex yeastiness..	Med body, creamy. .. .	Great stuff.  A classic belgian beer - definately a style-defining one.
",5
4796,"Pours very heady out of the bottle, and the head takes a while to go down. It is a dark amber color and has good color density. It is hard to see through. The beer smells like sweet wheat and honey. It is a fairly crisp smell. It has a medium sweet wheat taste to it. It is distinctive and has good flavor density. The beer also feels very heavy and carbinated in my mouth. Overall, a pretty darn good beer. You should try it out if you like a belgian beer with some good flavor.
",5
4797,"Thick chestnut brown pour.  Aroma of mild coffee with cinnamon, cream and sugar drowning its character.  Non-dememo  flavor of wheat bread and rum with an earthy foundation.  Very tame.  Mildly bittered, more in a nutty sense.  Some vinous qualities of interest.  Palate is diluted.  Lacks personality.
",1
4798,"Picked up a single 11.2 oz bottle from Cellars Wine & Spirits in St Paul, MN. Pours a hazy golden dark brown brew with a thick fizzy off white head that slowly dissolves to a fine film. Very nice lacing. Aroma of dried apricots, banana bread, caramel, and a little bread dough. Taste is highly carbonated, medium body and some acidic taste in the back of the tongue. Finish is sweet, creamy and slightly bitter.
",5
4799,"Light crisp aroma, not as strong as I would expect.  Rich, fully bodied mahogony color.  Sweet caramel taste with a smooth aftertaste and pleasant bite.  It has a slightly hazelnut tint that rolls into the caramel and out very smoothly.

4805,"A very tastefull full bodied and not to strong nice trappist beer. Really better as most of the American beers i tasted in a L.A. pub. They had the 3 trapisst beers of chimay on large bottle. And I drunk a chimay just before coming back to Belgium. Really a must for all beer raters
",5
4806,"Bottled. An unclear deep red beer with a light brown and small foam. Malty aroma, sweet with some caramel. The flavour is malty, some spiciness and dry. The body is not as strong  as other trappist beer. Light bitterness at the end. Nice and drinkable.
",5
4807,"(Bottle) Pours a brown color with a small off-white head. Light aroma of Belgian yeast. Tastes include sugar, and some dried dark fruits. Light spice as well. Slight alcohol warming in the finish. Good palate as well. A pretty good brew.
",5
4808,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2007 corked bottle:  I love everything about this beer.  I usually get a bottle every Christmas, tradition with the cork.  Great spicy, malty, fruity, dense aroma & flavour.  This is a perfect example of how to make a flavourful & complex tasting brew with a higher alcohol content, but still have it all come together in a pleasant manner.  Not everyone will like this one though, they might need it paired with the right food.  I love this beer, what  a great strong ale.
",5
4809,"Bottle -- Pours with a fairly dense beige head with a bit of retention and quite good lacing. A murky brown with very active, very fine bubbles. Aroma is alcohol and over-ripe fruit. Round palate with perhaps a little harshness -- a little electric like somone else said. Flavour is quite sweet with fruit cake and some caramel, with an aftertaste of alcohol. Even though the alcohol content isnt that high, I find it gives the beer more of a ""bite"" than that lovely alcohol warmth you get with Chimay Blue. A wonderful beer just the same.
",5
4810,"Pours copper color with two finger head that diminishes quickly.  Compared to the Chimay white I had a few minutes ago, the red is much better.  Flavor lasts longer.
",5
4811,"I love Chimay Red.  Try to drink after sitting in your glass a while.  It often comes a little too carbonated, and the wait raises the temperature to bring out the flavor. Great balance of sweetness and hops.  There are many better beers, but this is certainly one of the best 7% beers.  I prefer Red to Blue Chimay.
",5
4812,"33cL bottle.  Pours a clear, orange-amber color; off-white head with good lacing.  Dried fruits and esters in the aroma; vinous and slightly grapey.  Medium-to-full, estery mouthfeel: grapey, vinous character; strong ester and yeast component; well-balanced, layered, and very drinkable.  Medium yeasty, estery, and dried fruit finish.
",5
4813,"Bottle.  Pours a deep amber/copper color with a thin beige head.  Aroma is abundantly yeasty with some malt and some fruitiness.  Flavor is somewhat sweet, with a good malt tone, some dark fruits and a dash of hops.  Medium bodied.  Obviously a well-crafted beverage, but I prefer the Bleu & Blanche better.
",1
4814,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2007 To me Chimay, as a brand name, represents the distinctly European sophistication and erudition that was somehow lost when those early continentals floated across the Atlantic to our fledgling nation.  Not that America doesnt have its fair share of scholars and appreciable achievements in the sciences (social science too), but we never see any Henry Higgins wandering the streets carousing with locals and berating their ignorance.  Somehow the tweed jacket seems forced, with pipes replaced by cigarettes and tea by coffee.  The Chimay Red is a drinkable vestige of this Old World cognoscenti, passionate and assertive, yet refined and reserved.  Its colored like a well-used redwood mantle piece cast in slivered sunlight, blanketed in dust, and crowned with a thick, spongy, heavy cream colored head.  Aged, odiferous cheese is the mainstay of the aroma, conjuring images of cheese served on ornate silver platters, smooth, salty but also pungent.  The distinctive smell of yeast adds to the fermentation theme, inciting a hunger for some bread, while a white grape note rounds out the savory flavors with a traditional and classic, wine-like character.  The Chimay Reds taste is abound with similar tried and true flavors, emanating a feel of traditional French cooking.  Before I notice any specific ingredients, however, Im struck by the smooth and creamy texture of the Red.  It is frothy and soft  a gratifying mouth feel, perfect for indoors or temperate weather drinking.  The flavors catch me by surprise as I relish in the palate, introducing themselves with solid doses of banana fosters, heavy cream, sweet orange liqueur and a generous proportion of alcohol.  Its warming to the touch, and a textural experience unlike any other.  The strong-willed flavors, especially the alcohol, make the Chimay Red a bold beverage, capable of holding its own even in the strongest culinary bouts, making it an ideal pairing for some heavier meals.  Root vegetable based stews, soups, pork roast and maybe even tender beef dishes, like a medium cooked Beef Wellington would all do well to meet the Chimay Red on equal terms on the tongue.  It is satisfying, fancy and assertive, and every bit a beer that gives me the feeling Im enjoying it in an intellectual parlor somewhere in a charming, urban European setting on a cool spring evening, although it would be of appreciable service in almost any environ.
",5
4815,"Another fine offering from Chimay.  Not as good as the Blue in my opinion, little too sweet and lost points for a strange mouthfeel.  Poured from a 750 mL bottle; a nice dark red with a large but short lived beige head.		Tasted sweet with hints of dried fruits and malt.  Sweet aftertaste.		Overall, another good Trappist, something Id like to have again.
",5
4816,"Stubby bottle:  poured a amber brown with off-white bubbles, dark malt, some fruit and cola fragrances, faint caramel aroma, dark malt flavor with some spices, a lot of carbonation on the tongue which makes this ale real light on the palate, faint pepper or hop bite in the finish, light on the palate,	with all of the talk about this ale I was expecting a little more.
",1
4817,"750ml bottle. Reddish brown in colour with a small off white head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of fruits(plums, grapes), malt, yeast and bread. Flavor is moderately sweet with notes of plum and caramel, with a mild flavor of alcohol coming through in the end. Finishes dry with almost no bitterness. Very lively carbonation, almost rivaling that of canned pop. I look forward to trying the rest of the chimay lineup.
",5
4818,"Pours red brown with beige head.Aroma is of fruit and alcohol.Appearance is cloudy unfiltered.Flavor is of plums.Palate is tangy acidic with an electric aftertaste.Overall a good brew, a little too sour for my tastebuds,maybe an orange peel would help.It has a mild hops presence.
",5
4819,"Bottle. 11.2 FL. OZ.  A hazy dark orange to brown color with large, off-white head that quickly dissapates. Aromas of fruit, bread, and malt.  Nice amount of carbonation that seems to sizzle on my tongue.  Moderate sweet flavor followed by a dry finish.  A fine ale.
",5
4820,"My least favorite of the Chimay red white and blue pack, but still pretty good. Tastes better when it isnt as cold. Slightly too sweet and not as complex as the other Chimay. Lighter taste, with low alcohol flavor.
",5
4821,"Dark, cloudy copper with sizable off-white head. Fruity, sweet aroma of plums, candy along with some earthy, dusty notes. The flavor is comfortably sweet as is the finish though some moderate bitterness slips in. Lively carbonation, watery texture. Served a little too cold, it improved as it warmed. Nonetheless, there are other dubbels that have more heft, more complexity and are more rewarding for the taste buds. Not that I would turn down a Rouge if it were offered.
",5
4822,"Sampled at a blind abbey dubbel tasting hosted by tennisjoel on 4-14-07, along with eight other beers. This was the ninth and final beer that we tasted. It finished in fifth place in my rankings, but it was eighth place in the group rankings. Originally poured from a 750 mL bottle. The overwhelming winner of the night was t Smisje Dubbel, with Corsendonk Pater finishing a strong if distant second.		<P>Aroma features chocolate, vanilla, and soft candy. It is nice, but its too weak to score highly. Pours a very cloudy light brown with a lot of suspended particulate and short-lasting head. It definitely stood out visually from the rest of the beers that we tried that night. The taste is quite intriguing. It is somehow subtle and sharp simultaneously. The alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming in the taste. Subtle, good flavors overall. Medium in body. High carbonation Smooth, frothy, and lively in the palate. Chimay Rouge does not slap the drinker in the face with its aroma or flavors, but it is a good, quality beer that would stand up well to multiple tastings.
",5
4823,"Appearance: dark amber.	Aromas: candy, reminiscences of plums and dry grapes.	Flavor: reminiscences of the chocolate and coffee. Sweetness hides the alcoholic degree. Complex and persistent.	Palate: average body, soft texture.		My chimay preferred, I love this beer.
",5
4824,"Bottle, 750ml.  Had this at the Bier Markt in Toronto.  Best served at room temperature.  Pours a dark amber with a decent amount of head.  Let the beer sit a few minutes to let it breathe before consuming.  Nice aroma with hints of cinamon and orchard fruits.  This is the first Chimay Ive had and I loved every sip I took.  It tastes like a strong Leffe, with a sweet flowery taste, and a fruity aroma that stays with you until the last sip.  This beer isnt for everyone however.  It is very complex, and is not a beer one should be encouraged to chug.  Can be complimented with a hearty meal, or just had on its own.  Either way I loved it!
",5
4825,"Bottle shared by my friend Matt. Pours dark amber with some red hues, and a nice creamy off white head. Aroma of yeast, brown sugar, and dark fruits. Medium mouthfeel and very earthy mineral like texture. Flavor is moderately sweet, with notes of yeast and plums. Mild bitterness to balance it out, with some faint astringency. Not overly complex, but well crafted and enjoyable.
",5
4826,"Pours hazy with a dark amber color and copper highlights; head is off-white, full, and fizzy, but settles to an average, frothy, and somewhat lasting head with minimal lacing.  Nose is decent and somewhat subdued for the style but does carry a Chimay character; notes of yeast, prune, light brown sugar, some apricot maybe, and touch a a typical Chimay herb character.  Flavor is similar being sweet with a touch of bitterness carrying mild notes of herbs; brown sugar is dominant with some yeast, a light toastiness, date, and some faint apple note.  Palate is not quite medium, almost lively, and with a nice smooth feel, almost silky.  Finishes with some bitterness and an herbal note with short sweetness of brown sugar.  Fairly well put together dubbel and remarkably drinkable.  Nice to drink, but just not to the incredibly high expectations of the other Chimay brews; lacks the great complexites but does enjoy the smooth, drinkability of the white and especially the blue.
",5
4827,"Bottle at home. Pours an opaque rusty red. Yeasty aroma with some bread. Fruity and acidic flavour with a creamy caramel finish. Some flour and raisin there, too.
",5
4828,"Not in the same league as the Chimay Blue, but a decent trappist. Has a brownish-red colour with frothy white head. The taste has sweet caramel, fruits and spices. Not as much different tastes to enjoy as the blue.

4829,"Extremly light aroma slightly malty. Brown color with a small white head. Very smooth flavor. Carbonation sharpness to the finish.
",5
4830,"Bottled. Reddish brown. Starchy, corn flour aroma followed by thin, fruity flavour. Marred by aftertaste of damp cardboard with metallic overtones.  Chimay claims corners have not been cut with this beer, which I find hard to believe. A serious contender for worst trappist beer.

4831,"Dark brown, creamy head. Caramel, fruit, very balanced dubbel. I like it a lot!

4833,"UPDATED: MAR 17, 2011 Lovely. I hadnt had this in a couple years, and knocked back a couple bottles this evening at the Broad Street Cafe, Durham. Not quite as fruity and sticky as a lot of dubbels Ive sampled, this one is surprisingly lively and refreshing. Heavily carbonated, you still get a sense of the craft, with spices and some figs or matured apples coming through. Very fine.
",5
4834,"750 mL bottle.  Pours a cloudy brown.  Aroma is a bit yeasty, with a bit of a fruity zest coming through.  Flavour is intially spicy, followed by a bitter toastiness.  Carbonation is heavy, but works well with the spiciness and high alcohol content.  On the whole, a nice brew, but nothing superbly unique.
",1
4835,"Thick lacing white and bubbly head.  Deep amber in colour.  Looks very appetizing.  Smells sweet and a bit yeasty.  Tastes a bit metallic at first followed by a fruity/raisony sting, spicy.  I not really getting what all of the rage is about.
",1
4836,"nice dark brown appearance with a tan head.  flavor is full and of raisons and malts.  a solid double.  a good beer
",5
4837,"This bottle was in Marts 05, when I tasted it, out of date by the end of 07, so it was pretty young. It has a nice, creamy head, a beautiful mahogany color and a fruity aroma. The mouthfeel is semi-oily and the flavour is sweet and has the characteristic Chimay taste and notes of fruit. The bitterness is light, but OK and the alcohol is still too dominant in this young beer.
",1
4838,"Excellent beer...pour a dark copper color with a nice head a great lacing.  I smelled raisins, malt and spice.  The taste is very complex, a nice change up from the white and blue.
",5
4839,"750ml. Beautifully well rounded. The flavor, the body, the carbination, the aftertaste and the aroma rely on eachother to create a very well rounded, unique and unforgettable beer. The aftertaste reminds me of taking a deep breath of fresh, cold mountain air. A very good product all around.
",5
4840,"UPDATED: SEP 2, 2007 bottle. Its good to know that when youve been kicked out of the local pubs, you can still drive over to Tesco for a few tasty treats. Thanks to my mates for shoving a few of these and a bag of krispy kremes in my hands and pointing me at the checkout. Is it odd that while I bought this, my Belgian friends had English brew? Right, the beer... Amber brown with off white head. Malts and dark fruit in the nose. Taste to match with the addition of peppery spices. Very well rounded and pleasant. A goodun any time, but slightly over-rated in my opinion.
",5
4841,"11.2 oz bottle. Pours hazy dark copper color with off white head. Aroma and taste of malt very lite beer with a slight bitter after taste.
",5
4842,"Bottle - Dark amber/brown nice creamy head. Fruity aroma. Malty, hoppy with some complex flavors such as toffee, hints of raisin, etc.  I thinking this would go better with food than the Blue.
",5
4843,"pours a beautiful reddish brown.  smell is great, sweet and raisiny.  taste is subtle but damn its good.  slighly sweet, easy finish.  yummy.
",5
4844,"One of those beers you have drank often and forgot to rate.  Its a beautiful beer, fiery copper in color, suttle fruitiness to the nose.  I bring it and the blue to dinner parties often.  It is crips and refreshing with hints of honey and necture, a drink of the Gods.  It is served in country clubs across this nation.  Its a good starter chick beer if your girl gives you a hard time about rating.
",5
4845,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2007 11.2 oz bottle. Last of the three Chimays to be sampled, I liked this one...much like the others. Very solid beer, nice aroma, great taste, nice alc 7%. Solid all around.
",5
4846,"UPDATED: MAR 25, 2007 A pretty good beer and at a reasonable price. The flavor has a apple fruitiness to it and overall it was a great beer
",5
4847,"I first discovered this beer in a small hidden-away bar in Ambleside in the Lake District, England, and it has to be one of my favourites, with Leffe running it close for top spot. The white and blue are also good, but the palate of the red is delightful. Serve semi-chilled with a generous head, preferably in a wide goblet-style glass. The corked bottle adds a touch of class to a beer-tasting evening! The only down side really is the somewhat prohibitive price.
",5
4848,"I tried a bottle of this beer after not really liking the previous two Belgium beers I had (Nice Chouffe and Orval).  Neither were my type of beer.  I decided to try the Chimay, as it was recommended to me that if I didnt like the others I tried, I would probably like this one.  At first I did feel it tasted better than the other Belgium Ales I tried, but after awhile I realized that the aftertaste (which was a heavy amount of sweet/fruity overtones) was just not to my liking.  Since the Belgium Ales always seem to get high marks, I want to like them - but I guess my tastes go towards other types of beers (like a porter or a stout).  I am not saying this beer is bad, far from it.  It is just not the taste I am personally looking for.
",5
4849,"Bottle 0.33L.	Brown-to-dark red hazy body with a huge, rocky, light brown head, mostly lacing with an excellent lacing; medium-to-large bubbles of thin density.	Aroma is moderate-to-heavy malty (caramel) and lightly hoppy (citrus); notes of yellow fruits, red wine and light alcohol.	Moderate sweet and light acidic flavour; in the finish a light-to-moderate bitter note also appears.	Medium body with a creamy texture; soft carbonation; light astringent feeling in the finish.	Very good beer.
",5
4850,"Pours a cloudy red oak with a foamy off-white head.  The flavor has hints of fruityness and leaves a heavy taste on the back center of the tongue. There is some bitterness but is complimented nicely with the hints of fruit sweetness .  An enjoyable drink.
",5
4851,"Cloudy brown hue, lasting light brown frothy head with fair lacing.   Toasted malt, light hoppiness with subtle fruitiness taste and smell, citrus and banana, medium to full body, sweet brown sugar, average duration.  The benchmark for an abbey dubbel.  Always good.
",5
4852,"Bottle. Appearance of head was two fingers frothy white that mostly diminished. Nice lacing. Body was light cloudy with partials in flow. Color was murky brown. Aroma was caramel, apricot, yeast, toffee, other notes of fruit, banana, light toasted, nuts. Medium bodied with a soft carbonation. Light dry texture I thought. Flavor was light sweet with good balancing bitterness. Sweet and again slightly dry finish.
",5
4853,"Ive had the blue the white and now this and all are pretty nice.  The white is my personal fav, but this will do.  Nice flowery/bread aroma with a throat heavy experience.  Not exactly what I want but it beats most crappy belgian imitations.
",5
4854,"12 oz bottle.  Pours a cloudy dark amber brown body under a small creamy off-white head that faded to a thin film that lasted for the duration.  Aroma is very fruity with some yeast, plum, raisins, light alcohol, caramel, and toffee.  Flavor is similar to aroma up front, fruity with some toffee and caramel notes.  Yeast, light alcohol, and some risidual sweetness on the finish.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with lots of fizzy foaming carbonation.  Finishes with a little light stickiness.  Overall, a pretty decent beer.  This was one of my first forays into ""better beer"" many years back, and I really thought that this was the shit.  I guess that I have grown alot, but still nice to see that it is a pretty solid brew.
",5
4855,"UPDATED: JUL 19, 2011 Couleur orange cuivre avec beaucoup deffervescence. Plus lgre que la Chimay bleue avec ses notes dabricots et de prunes.
",5
4856,"Pours copper with a beige head. Aroma is roasted caramel and light dried fruit. Flavour is caramel, roasted notes and dried fruit.
",1
4857,"Ahh chimay - the biere that introduced us to trappistisme. Cant believe Im finally getting around to rating this guy. Pours a lighter shade of dark brown. Less head than I remember. A great balance of fruitiness and dark sugars ensues. Well done.
",5
4858,"Amber brown color with an off-white head that remains. A yeasty, malty nose. Mix of hazelnut, floral perfume and a hint vanilla. Malty and yeasty with caramel final. Strong alcohol % that you dont taste. Very nicely done. Ok its a Chimay. Do I want to be a monk? Well...
",5
4859,"Deep, but not impenetrable brown and gives a voluminous creamy white head that leaves excellent lace and takes a white to settle. The aromas are of powdered chocolate, cinnamon, brioche and full, lush stonefruit. Those chocolate and baking flavours hit first and then dehydrated apricot in muesli. Also nutty almond and  brazil nuts dance on the palate of this creamy, sexy ale. The finish is one of dessert and pistachio. There is nothing not to like.
",5
4860,"Medium brown in color. A nice head that dissipated quickly.  Aroma is chocolatey and nutty and the taste matches perfectly.  Smooth taste from start to finish with excellent flavors throughout.
",5
4861,"Im a bit disappointed.  Rather than complex it feels like more of a flavor competition.  I dont think Id drink this again.  Too much bread, bananas and cereal in the mouth, too much grass on the aftertaste.  A heap of cheesey yeast still resides in my mouth.  Its not bad, but its not very good either.
",1
4862,"Not quite up to the standard of the blue and the white, but still very enjoyable, not too malty for a dubbel, thank god, there is nothing worsen than a dubbel ruined because nits too malty. Very enjoyable.
",5
4863,"Bottle - Rich copper color with a fluffy, creamy head.  The flavor is of fruits and sugar.  The aroma hints at whats to come in the flavor.  The mouthfeel is full, but not heavy.  A well rounded Dubbel.
",5
4864,"UPDATED: AUG 28, 2008 Colorao marrom. Bom creme, persistente e um pouco denso. No h complexidade, mas h harmonia. Final amargo e seco.

4865,"750ml. Poured an orange hint with a tan head. Aroma is floral and fruity. Taste is full bodie has a banana hint in the finish.
",5
4866,"Bottle. Smooth with a orange-redish body. Hints of fruit with sweet finish. Very Nice.
",5
4867,"Beautiful orange-red color with a big white head. The head drops to a thin but consistent white layer. Aroma is sweet, caramel. Flavour is pleasant caramel, not soo sweet, with a little bit of citruous note. A very nice beer, I would like to have it more often.
",5
4868,"Pours a deep ruby with a huge, foamy tan head. Fruity aroma, with a bit of malt and yeast. Flavours of raisins, cherry, and coriander. Very smooth, creamy feel, with a nice hint of alcohol. Seriously amazing.
",5
4869,"33cl bottle served in a Chimay Trappist glass. Pours a ruby/amber color with a thick off white head, which dissipates quickly, leaving a white foamy ring. Aroma of yeast, bread, sweet fruits, malt, High carbonation. Coating mouthfeel, really sticks and stays with you. Fruit notes on the tongue. Dry aftertaste, with the malt coming through nicely. Didnt really get a bitter feeling with this ale. Fantastic sipping beer, very warming and no sense of the ABV.
",5
4870,"Red light blue light red light blue....I love you...Stompin in the yard is like having a glass with some class with this fine spec-im-ine.
",5
4871,"3/11/07: Bottle.  Orange-ruby body with a thick & creamy almond colored head.  Nose is fruity.  Flavor is fruity with yeast and esters.  Very smooth.
",5
4872,"Bottled. Blackcurrant, smoke and fruits on the nose. Red/brown with a thick white head. Very foamy, extremely lively and thick on the palate. Taste of berries among others..
",5
4873,"Bottle. Pours cloudy nutty brown. Medium off-white head. Leaves beautiful lacing. Smells of sweet caramel and definate fruityness. Tastes very fruity, no alcohol or bite at all. Nice and complex. Coats the palate beautifully.
",5
4874,"UPDATED: APR 14, 2008 Second place finisher in my book! Belgium sure knows how to make good beers. And Chimay is easy to get in Chicago, dont know if it is as good here as it is in Belgium
",5
4875,"Pours a dark yellow color, with a slight head. Has alot of carbonation, with hints of different fruits. Kind of bitter aftertaste.
",5
4876,"Beautiful copper color, fizzy head, very satisfying. Aroma is fruity, as most trappists are, with clean, sweet finish. Very Nice!
",5
4877,"Dark copper colour,with a nice malty nose and a full rounded malt fruit with a bitter finish
",5
4878,"Shared with a friend.  Pours a nice amber color with no head.  Taste of soap and dried fruit.  Taste is very sweet.  Great beer
",5
4879,"750 mL Pours a hazy reddish copper with an inch thick off-white head. Typical belgian yeasty smell with some dark fruits coming through. The head disipates rather quickly. Sugary, fruity (notably apricot) and pleasant malt in the taste. Almost no alcohol to be detected here.  A really nice abbey that finishes without the bitter aftertaste of most Belgians.
",5
4880,"Pours dark oxidised copper, hazy with an off -white rocky lasting head. Aroma of malt, trappist yeast and fruit (apricot). Flavour reflects the aroma: sweet malt with fruity notes, later becoming dry with light hop bitterness. Very nicely balanced. A very satisfying abbey dubbel on par with Westmalle.
",5
4881,"A step below the grande reserve but only barely. Sampled with some belgian dark chocolate. Such a nice combo. Aroma is sweet with rich malts. Appearance is very brune. Mouthfeel is tremendous and pure. Flavor is so malty and good. Another great chimay. Really hard to beat.
",5
4882,"UPDATED: FEB 28, 2007 750mL bottle sampled out of a Trappist glass.  Great beer!  Amber/copper colored head.  Smells of fruit, malt, and some yeast.  The taste is dominated mostly by sweet fruit, which may be perceived by some to be too sweet for their taste.  Moderately sweet finish that lingers on my tongue.  I think this is a great beer, but I feel its a little too sweet for me (possibly because of the added sugar).  If youre going to sample a Chimay beer, Id recommend a Blue or White label over this...
",5
4883,"(bottle)poured into a chimay glass.  good beer, I like this better than the more popular blue.  more on the front, better in the finish.  a great beer to enjoy with a meal, as I did.  I was suprised to like this better than the blue.  cheers...
",5
4884,"Poured from 11.20 oz bottle. Poured a hazy copper color, very small head that faded quickly. Aroma of dried fruit. Slight carbonation. Taste of light apples, almost cider like, raisins, sugar...Slightly sweet up front, but not overwhelming. Slightly bitter tart finish that was really quite delightful. This is an excellent Trappist Ale. The best I have had so far...Flavors very well blended!
",5
4885,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2007 Beautifull dark red appearance. More hobby and flowery than fruity. Plesant sparkling smooth palate. Sweetbitter flavor of toffee and hobs. Id prefer Chimay Blue but definetly enjoy this one too
",5
4886,"Pours a cloudy amber colour with an off white head which disappears almost completely. I personally love the sweet smell familiar to ales yet almost fruity presence. More carbonated than most ales Ive tried but the given carbonation enhances its qualities. The taste itself is of an ale with a gentle touch of fruit to it as well as toffee and maybe a little bit of cocoa-like flavor. Excellent beer.
",5
4887,"33 cl bottle. Deep cloudy red with large stable beige head. Malty aroma with lots of dried fruit (peach and apricot) and a clear yeast note, and a hint of spicy hops. Medium to thick bodied, smooth mothfeel, perfect carbonation. Some malt sweetness in the flavour that is avertaken by an earthy, dry finish.
",5
4888,"Bottle @ Coles Buffalo NY. Poured into a Chimay glass. Amberish Brown with nice pillowy head. Lots of dried fruit. Love this beer.
",5
4889,"Chimay Red pours an amber color with a trademark Chimay thick white head. You can never go wrong with a Chimay.
",5
4890,"11.2oz bottle, poured into Chimay chalice. Pours cloudy brown, with a moderate tan head. Aroma is sweet; candi sugar, raisins, chocolate and orange.Sweet initially, which gives way to spice and a medium alcohol finish.
",5
4891,"UPDATED: JUL 13, 2008 An interesting dark, murky burgundy color with a thick head that dissapeared quickly and left a laced ring and slight film. An interesting aroma which despite familiar smells I cannot quit pin down, i think oakes may be right with the raisen bread. The flavor was milder than I expected but good, notes of toffee, bread, and as with chimay blue notes of banana. An interesting beer all and all. But I much prefer chimay blue over red.
",5
4892,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2008 Both 330ml and 750ml bottles. Delicious clear dark red/brown body with a good beige head. The aroma is sweet malt, dry fruit and demerara sugar. The flavor is also sweet malt, some dried fruit type raisin or date, caramel, alcohol, spices and yeast. Maybe the sugar are drowning some of the other impressions compared with the Chimay Blue. A complex beer, but not a true classic. I remember this beer as a lot better some years ago.
",5
4893,"Bottle, 33 cl. Cloudy amber colour with a thick off-white head. Spicy, yeasty & fruity aroma. Fruity flavour, perhaps with a tinge of alcohol.
",5
4894,"This was poured into a trappist glass from bottle at an irish pub (in Ohio).  The nose was that of alcohol and raisen, very fruity, almost tuitty.  You can tell it was a fine beer because it relaxed me into a state of peacefulness.  Although it diffenitely could have been the atmosphere on this one, it was a fine setting.
",5
4895,"This is definitely a fine beer. Like all Trappists it looks wonderful in its correct glass. Spicy and dry, with some complexity, a little chocolate, a little fruitiness. Unfortunately however, I will always find it hard not to view this as Chimay Bleus less interesting brother.
",5
4896,"Large Bottle. Hazy red/brown pour no real lacing to speak of. Aroma of belgian spices and fruit. Flavor is malt and cherrys. A bit of a dry finish. I am not a huge belgian fan but this was good.
",5
4897,"Another good belgian brew.		Pour is a dark, cloudy amber color. The head forms up nice and lasted a while. The smell is a little light, compared to the other Chimays. Taste is good, crisp and you can feel the carbonation just enough. Very good brew, just not my favorite of the style.
",5
4898,"Carmel hue with a white frothy head that dissapated quickly.	Nice aroma with faint almost clove smell with alcohol.	Nice taste of malty spice that yeilds to a yeasty taste that lingers.  Initially enjoyed it, but the longer it lingered the more yeast and flowery it became on my palate slightly deminishing the experience.  Nice initial mouthfeel, but again almost feels coated in my mouth instead of light.  reccommend to those that enjoy the yeast.
",5
4899,"Deep, hazy ruby.  Fruity nose. Tasty yet not as complex as the blue label.  Red must get tired of living in Blues shadow.
",5
4900,"UPDATED: JAN 3, 2008 Re-rate 1/3/08: 330 ml bottle (quite fresh). Dark brown color with a large beige head. Aroma of malt, caramel, yeast and some fruitiness. A semi-dry flavor with malt (and some malt sweetness), some caramel and some spices. A drier finish with some yeast and notes of alcohol. A medium to full body and a bit overcarbonated. No real complexity and definitely not as great as I remembered it but still a decent Dubbel.7/4/7/3/14=3.5750 ml bottle (4.5 to 5 years old). Dark red-brown color. Aroma is sweetish and fruity with caramel, raisin and a bit of alcohol. Flavor is fruity and spicy with some sweetness. Finish is pretty mellow but with some soft bitterness. A medium to full body. 8/4/7/4/16=3.9
",5
4901,"Bottle. Red brown colour with a beige head. Aroma is cellar, caramel, spices. Flavour is roasted, balanced, fruits, caramel, spices, malt.
",5
4902,"floral aroma a bit muddy in apperance, hoppy floral flavor followed subtel malt nice finish
",5
4903,"Pours deep carmel with a nice medium head. Aroma is light and fruity. Nicely carbonated.  Malty, sweet, fruity, NICE.	A well craft brew.
",5
4904,"UPDATED: APR 3, 2007 0.33L bottle in pint glass. Billowing tower of soft foam settles slowly on a heavily steeped copper-tea, and leaves a nice tatting all round. Yeast sediment riding atop the creamy cap gives the appearance of cinnamon-sprinkled cappucino, and the quarter-inch of cream lasts all the way down. Nose is bitter yeast/nut/corn/hop/skunk. Extremely well-blended and difficult to isolate any dominant taste. Creamy palate is the best I have sampled, almost like a cask nitro. Definitely on the dry side, and hoppier than other Belgians I have sampled. Alcohol not evident at all. This is a good  beer, but the yeast/hop combination has a taste twang that is slightly unpleasant to me.
",5
4905,"UPDATED: APR 21, 2007 Rerate: Pour is amber and a murky consistency.  Head is there but pretty much totally disappears.  Flavor is dried fruit and some sour apple.  I think one of the problems with this beer is the flavor is too thin for the carbonation level.  Maybe if the carbonation was toned down, the flavors would come out better.  Well, I had some the second day and this had improved after this flattened out. 	Original rating: 11.2 oz bottle.  Muddy orange brown body with small yeast particles floating throughout.  Light aromas of band aid, spice, and some dried fruits.  Rather large head quickly diminishes.  Light bodied.  Heavy on the carbonation with a dry finish.  This by no means is terrible, but this has to be the weakest out of the Chimay line (although I havent had the white or blue for a long time).  I remember being fairly impressed by those beers.  This one, is more average.  Simple, but Im looking for complex when paying $4-$5 for a bottle of this. 	Aroma: 6 	Appearance: 4 	Flavor: 6 	Palate: 4 	Overall: 14 	Total Score: 3.4
",5
4906,"Bottle. Dark brown colour with a huge head. Aroma and flavour of malt, spice, fruit, caramel and hops.
",5
4907,"Bottle from LCBO. Drank with a chicken curry dish. Pours a dark reddish-brown with an intense amount of head. Nose is of rasberry and strawberries, and smells very sweet and rosy. Mouthfeel is creamy and the tongue is hit by a very tart and spicy flavour. Palate is fairly simple, and once again, I am disappointed by the complexity of Chimay. Lacing is heavy on the glass and looks rather attractive in a snifter. A decent brew, but I will not be buying again.
",1
4908,"Nice yeasty nose.  Pours to a deep brown color. Very clean finish and good mouth feel, but not a terribly large amount of taste. Slightly spicy taste, but overall quite clean.
",5
4909,"Pours a copper brown color with a huge head. It is very lacey. Aroma of hops and malt. Taste a hint of vanilla.
",5
4910,"Small irregular head. Very sticky to the glass. Rather neutral smell with only a small amount of spices. Malty sweetness with some spices. Light body. Medium carbonation. Medium aftertaste. Not my favourite trappist.
",1
4911,"UPDATED: MAR 18, 2007 Pours a beautiful dark red with lots of head and lace. Nice fruity aroma.  Incredibly smooth and creamy in the mouth.  Taste is not incredibly complex but its still great.
",5
4912,"dark brown, huge head, lots of yest, and dried fruit in the aroma. flavour is all dried fruit, nice and complex, little bitter in the finish. quality stuff.
",5
4913,"Bottle 11.2 oz.  A dark tawny, brown opaque, hue.  Mild aroma which hints at the mild taste of malt and caramel with only a touch of hops.  Medium body, that does in fact, ""impart a silky senasation to the tongue,"" but with a lot of carbonation.  Well balanced, pleasant, and excellent.  Too mild for my tastes but very easy to drink and enjoy.
",1
4914,"Dark brown/red, lots of lacing, large head with good retention. Aroma of Chimay-yeast and a very peculiar spicyness that I cant put my finger on, but I sure as hell dont like it. It is somewhere in between baby-food (the canned sludge) and stale puke - with a bit of goose liver thrown in. This smell got more and more pronounced as the beer warmed. Dark fruit in the background though, if you can believe it. Decent taste, a bit too soft/rounded for me - maybe too balanced. And ofcourse, the gooseliver babypuke notes didnt help much. Smooth mouthfeel, a bit like the aforementioned babyfood-sludge, stale puke and goose liver were thrown into a blender and mashed into a delicious smoothie. Not much carbonation, but hey, what would you expect from a goosepuke babyliver smoothie anyway? This one started out like a fine, fine dubbel but turned into something that reminded me of what lies behind the gates of Hell.
",1
4915,"[Bottled, January 2007] Burgundy color. Brief large frothy head. Fizzy mouthfeel. Fruity aroma and flavor. Combination of cherry and apricots. Reminiscent of Three Philosophers yet more inviting.

",5
4917,"[Tasted at Riks, lArtisan, birthday in 2004.]  		Spicy and yeasty and a beer you can enjoy for more than a couple of minutes. I spend about an hour swallowing this nice beer.
",5
4918,"First beer of the night at Cask, in Manchester.  Dark brown with a white head that lasts in my gold-rimmed Chimay goblet.  Aroma pleasing but not overbearing:  ripe dark fruits, caramel malt, slight spice through a coriander/orange sweetness.  Taste is again dark pit fruits, bittersweet chocolate notes are apparent, with a spicy or peppery front and a slight bitterness in the after.  Smooth and nicely carbonated.
",5
4919,"Pours a cloudy tan/light brown color with an off white lacy head.  Smells of malt and flowers.  tastes a bit fruity with a hint of hops and a lot of malt.  Very simple flavor, not as complex as other beers, but excellent nonetheless.  I highly recommend it.
",5
4920,"11.2 Oz Bottle-Pours a cloudy brown color w/a slight tan head & good lacing. Floral Belgian aroma. Light, nutty, fruity, taste, with some traces of dates, figs, appricots & raisins. Crisp clean flavor w/a long dry finish. Pretty good, was expecting a little more.
",5
4921,"330 ml bottle. Best before the end of 2010. Gusher, but only a little. Dark copper colour with a bright red hue. Small, almost non-existing, off-white head. Soapy, dry mnchenermalt aroma. Crisp from high carbonation level. Quite dry with some malts. A bit disappointing as it is quite neutral flavourwise. Bland. Its balanced, but does not stand out in any way. Very disappointing. Will have to retry.

4922,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2007 (Bottle) Pours a bit hazy redish brown. Spicy and fruity aroma with apples, some alcohol and yeast. Undertones of caramel, banana, herbs, malt and sugar. A bit sourish in the nose and taste. Light spicy, malty flavour with some fruits and just a touch of roasted and bitter tones. Meduim sweet. Pretty creamy mouthfeel. Medium body.
",1
4923,"Bottle. Burgundy with thin off-white head. Hoppy with a sweetish malt nose. Some old fruit there. Malty taste and easy to drink, slightly bitter, winter fruit. Slightly watery, but with hints of spice. Alcohol in the palate, quite fruity though.

",5
4925,"A 11.20 oz bottle with not made or freshness date on it. The beer pours a creamy dark brown with a tan head that goes away fast and leaves no lacing. The smell is a bittersweet hops and malts. The taste was a crisp and malty. A good carbonation and the taste is wonderful.
",5
4926,"Pours a murky brown with a creamy off-white, two finger head that fades slowly to a thick cap and leaves a thick sheeting of lacing.		Smell; a little bit of some dark fruits, and a touch of chocolate. Its hard to really pick many aromas out, as the smell much more subdued than I would have expected.		Taste; as with the smell, the flavors are not very assertive. Theres a little bit of raisins and some chocolate. Theres aso a bit of apples as well as a slightly woody quality.The mouthfeel is a bit watery and thin, and rather boring for a dubble.		This is a good beer, but for the price, there are many others that I would rather spend the money on.
",5
4927,"Served at Piano Blue in Pewaukee.  This was the finest beer available but difficult to extract from  the beer-clueless Bartender.  Show a litttle pride in your work man!  Poured a cloudy reddish brown with a slight viscosity, and a big off-white head.  Full bodied and complex, with a mix of fruit, bread and yeast flavors. This was a lifesaver and pretty much made my evening out.
",5
4928,"UPDATED: OCT 27, 2008 Pours dark red with a sizeable head.  Aroma is malty and floral.  Flavor is complex but not as much as that of the bleu.  Mouthfeel is very nice.  Finish is exceptionally dry.  Satisfying, but not as impressive as the grand reserve.
",5
4929,"Pours a ruddy brown, cloudy, with about two inches of beige foam. The head dies down quickly to a thin cap and a ring. A thin stream of bubbles rise from the etched bottom of the Chimay chalice. Very nice lacing. Mild sweet bready malt in the aroma.		The taste is rather dry and grainy, with a hint of musty peat malt. Beyond the dryness, I taste some mild fruit, sweet bread, and yeast. Lets call it medium bodied, with a bit of weak, flat, diluted rum & coke in the aftertaste.

4930,"The best widely available Belgian dubbel until Westmalle becomes more widely nkown. Crisp, spicy, rich and full.

4931,"Pours orangy brown with a thick, frothy, off-white head. Standard but pleasant spicy and fruity aroma. Flavor is quite spicy, fruity notes with citrus like acidity, and slight bitternss towards the finish. Palate is light/medium, effervescent, with lingering spice, a hint of sweetness, and light bitterness. Not that complex, but well-balanced, easy drinking, and enjoyable
",5
4932,"UPDATED: OCT 8, 2007 The color was a hazy red/orange.  The head was fizzy and white.  The aroma was raisin and sweet with some citrisy notes.  The flavor was not as complex as I had expected.  There was a very slight sour/yeasty element as well as alcohol, raisin, and an aged taste.  The palate was carbonated and the finish light and a little waxy.
",5
4933,"Poured a reddish brown with a medium thin, light tan head. The aroma had spicy notes, with the yeasty/earthy/sour Belgian smell, and some citrus notes. The flavor was big up front yeast taste, some citrus/spice taste, a little thin and lacking complexity. The palate was a little thin, yet lively with carbonation. The finish was warming from alcohol.
",5
4934,"25.4 oz bottle.  Pours a clear brown with a good head.  Somewhat lighter taste than other trappists, but malty and fruity, it is brewed with water from the brewing monestary which gives this beer a pleasently interesting flavor.  Reccomended.
",5
4935,"The 25.4 ounce amber bottle poured a beautiful, clear reddish amber beverage with a creamy ample off white head that was entirely lasting and left beautiful lacing on the glass. The aromas were fruity and spicy with green apple, apricot and pepper standing out. It has a nice medium body, not overbearing. The carbonation is smooth and the texture is lightly dry. The flavor starts off lightly sweet and fruity. Within a few moments a nice tart dryness develops and the two balance each other lasting through the long warming finish.
",5
4936,"Second best beer from Chimay that i have tried. Very tasty beligan beer with amber/copper cloudy color. Well balanced. Good anytime of year
",5
4937,"Pours an attractive cloudy brown with nice head.  Aromas are sweet and spicy.  Flavors are quite complex, tipping the scales  to a somewhat darker flavor than the other Chimays.  Somewhat heavy, kind of meaty almost, and quite smokey.  Finish comes off with a much lighter sweetness with a tinge of sourness.  Quite complex and fun to analyze.
",5
4938,"From a 330 ml bottle. Commercial description has it about right, color is appealing brown, the head itself taste pretty good. Overall the beer is pretty sweet, caramelic and pleasant with an enjoyable bitterness that pops in right on time. Complex and easy to drink for a trappist. Pure quality.
",5
4939,"Big bottle. Nice red-brown colur with a big fluffy tan head. Aroma of malt indeed, sweet with a good fruitiness. The flavour has roasted malts, dark fruits, caramel, some alcohol. Long somewhat bitter aftertaste.
",5
4940,"Bottle.  Poured into snifter.  Pour is reddish brown with a dark white head.  Malt aroma, and the taste is perfectly roasted malt.  get a touch of almost wood / whisky in the finish.  Fantastic complexity, and extremely drinkable.
",5
4941,"Another great brew from the trappists.  Strong but not overwhelming.  Drinkable and good.  pours quality and remains quality till the end.
",5
4942,"33cl bottle pours hazy ruby brown with a fair offwhite head that fades back to a ring but laces the trappist glass from there down.  Aromas of caramel, roasted malt, and some hay.  Flavor is smooth caramel, raisin, some honey, a little clove as well.  Nice and sweet throughout with slight bitterness before the dry finish.  Medium body and soft carbonation.  This is really nice beer.  I cant believe Ive waited this long to try something so readily available to me.  Ill be trying the blue and the white soon..
",5
4943,"Poured a light brown and coppery color, quite transparent and bubbly. Had a thick head that dissipated fairly quickly. It smelled of fruit, hops, some malt and a slight bit of grass. Its taste had a very smooth and moderately strong malt profile, seemed like mediums to dark roasts. It was slightly sweet and tasted of fruit and had a fairly strong bitter hop finish, but not as strong as an IPA. This was a good beer, darker flavor than I expected. It lacked the complexity youd expect but it is very smooth.
",5
4944,"Poured from 330ml bottle into snifter glass. Cloudy brown-red colour, large off-white head that falls away relatively quickly and leaves little to no lacing. A big aroma of sweetly sharp malts, caramel, multiple fruits like orange and spices. Taste dominated by malt, caramel and dark fruits, as well as a toasty edge. Mouthfeel is a little rough and in some parts watery, which detracts from the drinkability. Medium body with medium-to-high carbonation. Overall a mostly enjoyable beer, but far from a ""wow!"" beer. Seems a somewhat straight forward abbey dubbel.

4948,"Bottle from Tesco poured into a Westmalle glass.  Very dark red, with a well formed and generous head.  Tastes fruity, slightly sweet, its a little less comples a brew than I was expecting.	The aroma is rich, hoppy and fruity, nice.  Nice on the palate, though not as good as the Blaauw.
",5
4949,"Tasted in Tatoverede Enke, Copenhagen. Pours hazy golden with a big creamy off-white head. Lively carbonated.Aroma of dark sweet fruits, good malty sweetness. Taste is light sweet, malty with some alcohol presence, port wine and some nice spices, good choice. Complex and simple.

4950,"Aroma of.plums, yeast and malts.  Pours a hazy red with a bubbly head.  Tastes of sugar cane, wheat and tasty yeast.  Its the tastiest glass of bread Ive had in a while.

4951,"33cL bottle.  Good Belgian bier, especially considering the mass-production.  I prefer the blue label but this is a quality bier as well.

",5
4953,"Bottle... poured a dark ruby color with a frothy white head. Roasted malt aroma which was almost wine like.  And a very fizzy , full palate. Tastes of sweet malt and alcohol with other fruity flavors. Finished smooth and short.
",5
4954,"Pours a deep red with a small white head to it. Aroma is of spices, dark fruit possibly plums, yeast and a twinge of alcohol. I will say the aroma is really nice and this is a great beer to smell. The taste is nice with some spice and yeast. Alcohol is also noticed but the fruit I smelled in the aroma is not represented well in the taste which was dissapointing. Ends with a pleasing bitterness and astringency but carbonation is a bit high in my opinion. Also not nearly as silky a mouthfeel as expected.
",1
4955,"From 33cl bottle into chalice. Nice head, although it did not last as long as I would have wanted. Wonderful aroma and flavor, with a medium long finish.
",5
4956,"First off, this was cellared for a year and a half (large corked bottle).  Poured a dark ruby red.  The head was the dark side of tan, going to lace after first showing up substantially for a minute or two.		Smells quite floral, sweet and fruity.  I have to make the comparison to Hoegaarden... its similar in aroma.  As it warms, the alcoholic notes waft up a bit more.		Nicely carbonated.  Mouthfeel is good and average.  Nothing amiss.		Tastes a bit woodsy with definite high alcohol notes.  Tart initially, then bitter towards the finish.  The aftertaste is a pleasant sour.  As it warms, you get a bit of vanilla.		I quite like this.  A nice one to bring out on special occasions.
",5
4957,"A pleasing ruby pour with an ample but quickly diminishing head.  Looks like a foamy pinot noir.  Yeasty aroma with nuances I am at a loss as how to describe (aftershave?).  Pleasing creamy small bubble mouth feel.  Fruity flavor (cherry, banana, cloves) followed by a slightly mettalic and sour aftertatse.  Very interesting beer ... my frist Belgian ale.
",5
4958,"Poured the color of a deeply steeped tea, with the fizzy, snap-crackle-pop of a cherry soda.  Very artistically subtle aroma of yeast and malt.  Fizzy to the palate, not unlike a cola, with a quiet well balanced flavor of tea, cherry, malt, yeast, pear ... Very enjoyable.
",1
4959,"This copper ale poured with a typical fluffy Chimay head. There is a nice blend of malt and hops, resulting in a pleasant fruity flavor that is enhanced by the superior Chimay yeast. More bitter and less body than the Blue label.
",5
4960,"The small bottle.The only Chimay Ive drunk recently (its discounted in Tescos!). It looks lovely in the glass, a deep translucent ruby, with a good head. Slightly fruity and lighter than I expected. Nice, Ive got 5 more to drink and Im looking forward to it.
",5
4961,"Has a lot of carbonation, then when that fades, it is a much more delicious beer.  The malty flavor is almost slightly sweet.  It doesnt really last on the palate, but it delicious while it is there.
",5
4962,"UPDATED: DEC 14, 2006 A creamy white head sits atop an amber pour tinted with copper highlights.  Yeast, fruit and alcohol in the aroma.  The flavor is yeasty and fruity.  Cherry, raisin and pear came through.  A little on the fizzy side until it truly opens up.  Nice creamy mouthfeel with a pleasant warm alcohol finish.

4963,"75 cl bottle, Shelburne. Dark brown pour with orange highlights. Thin head that clings to the sides. Spice and fruit aroma. Very effervescent. Sweet upfront that fades to bitterness.

4964,"341 ml bottle. Deep copper with a thin beige head. Aroma is spicy with yeast, malt and dark fruits. Taste is malty and sweet, but well balanced, spicy, coriander, some dark fruits and brown sugar.

4965,"Bottle. Pours ruby red color with large creamy head. Looks very nice in glass. Dry fruits and spicy in the aroma and taste. Very soft and pleasant mouth feel and alcohol taste. Dry with a sour finish. Very nice beer.

4966,"This beer has a much more malty aroma then taste. It has a dark amber appearance. Very nice yellowish dead. A nice crisp citric flavor. A really nice beer
",1
4967,"330ml Bottle: Pours ruby brown in colour, a very large head with decent lacing.  Aroma of pepper and plums, perhaps a little coriander.  Flavour offers significant amounts of the pepper and plum, coriander and orange peel.  Very creamy mouthfeel, especially as it warms more and more.  Terrific stuff.
",5
4968,"Not bad, not great. The beer was a dark brown to black color with a tan head. The major thing I noticed about this was the overcarbonation. It almost tasted like flavored seltzer water. There were the obvious tasted of fruit and spices, but I could not taste in any great quantities over the carbonation. The aftertaste was non existent. I had this in the 11.2 oz bottle and the description is different than the one llisted. For the $8 price tag I paid at Mad Mex in Robinson, I expected a lot more. I am curious to try the others.
",5
4969,"Appearance is a very dark , rusty orange/amber in color.  Smells consists of slight yeast with some apparent spices.  Carbonation is above average, head is an white/tan in color, and lasts until the beer is gone.  Lacing is moderate.  A very smooth mouthfeel to it and goes down quite well with a slight aftertaste to it.  Overall a very enjoyable beer.  I have been waiting to try the Chimays and after sampling the Red I will try the other styles.  I will be going back to this and have some available for just sitting back and enjoying a really good beer.

4972,"Very nice.  Yeasty with a touch of fruitiness.  Good, not my favorite trappist, but still worth a try
",5
4973,"Pours a dark amber with a slightly tanned head. Sweet with aromas of raisins and prunes. Slightly yeast and peppery. Medium to full bodied. Strong sweet, dry finish.
",5
4974,"Poured with a decent head with some lacing.  Had the color of a dark apple cider.  aroma was only slightly noticable at the temperature i was served it, but opened up as it warmed.  Spices, fruits and some sweetness were detected.  Taste was lighter than I expected.  Sweet with spices and some fruit notes as well.  Rather carbonated, but not to the point of annoyance.  Its definitly somehitng Id like to try again.
",5
4975,"750 mL bottle.  Deep translucent chestnut brown, with far less head than I expected.  Fruit (apples), bread, and alcohol.  Bread with strawberry jam, to be specific.  Taste is simpler than expected.  Some brown sugar sweetness.  Maybe apple pie with cinnamon.  Quite heavily carbonated, but still a substantial mouthfeel.  A bit of bitterness at the end.  Taste lingers on the sides of the tongue.  Quite tasty.
",5
4976,"Pours deep red & brown with an off-white head.  I got this in The Sundial Restaurant in Atlanta.  The waiter presented this beer like it was an expensive bottle of wine.  I loved the taste and feel of this beer.  it went down smooth with a long lasting flavor.  A must have!!
",5
4977,"Apple cider unfiltered appearance. Foams up nicely and thins out to a hlf centimeter head. Slight lacing on the glass. Apple cider-ish scent. Slightly bitter on the tongue, but sweet once warmed in the mouth. VERY carbonated with a bite on the sides of the mouth. Generally pretty pleasant, still figuring out the spice (a slight, very slight nutmeg and cinnamon with the caramel). More citrusy fruits on the nose. (750ml Bottle Pour of 2005 Vintage 11/21/2006)

",5
4981,"UPDATED: FEB 4, 2007 Ive had it a bunch before but never rated it.  Pours amber with a nice robust head.  the taste is strong and tasty, but not super memorable.
",1
4982,"had this at Pianos bar on NYCs lower East side.  Wasnt really drinking too critically, but some dark dried fruit is noticible on the palate.  Perfect for sipping though and went down smooth and soft.  Nice ale that I could drink all night, but at $8/glass, I limited myself to one and switched to black and tans.
",5
4983,"Dark reddish brown with big off-white head. Aroma is of dark fruit and malt, flavor is the same, plums in the front. Silky texture that leaves a tingly sensation.
",5
4984,"Pours a brownish haze with red tint and a small head.  I expected more aroma from this, but the taste and smoothness makes up for it.  Easily drinkable beer, no bitterness, amazing taste, a bit tingly too.  Purchased in a three pack (Red, White, Blue) with glass as a seasonal package Id presume.  I will definitely try a ""full"" bottle in hopes for a better aroma, as of right now, that is all I see it lacking.
",5
4985,"Had afew times but never got around to rating this...how odd..is this beer forgetable, well, no...just with white and the blue, this falls in between like all middle kids....?...anyway, looks nice in a glass, real respectable looking lad...gripes.....smell is all that and a bag of chips, like most doobes....taste is pleasing, grinnnninng like a bastard....this is a good beer. its also aval everywhere, but lower the price a couple bucks, then the world would jump and scream...well, even mark dell liked this stuff so, people if he liked and i liked , try it, not the best (vest) dubbel but it is solid and happy ....over and out..

4986,"from the bottle into my trappist glass, 	brown in color light bitterness, however not overdone. this is an exellent beer to just sit and enjoy.
",5
4987,"750ml bottle - pours deep red/brown with a big off-white head. Sweet, dark fruits in the nose - dates, plums, and then the yeast. This trappist has a mildly sour vinous quality to it, with a foamy, fluffy, frothy mouthfeel that makes it very easy to drink. Well carbonated. Velvety smoothness coats the mouth and throat...really pleasant. Some spiciness, more fruits, and a light bitterness in the finish. Great beer that I drink quite regularly. Perhaps my favourite of the Chimay offerings.

",5
4989,"330mL bottle from the LCBO.  2010 best before date.  As always, wonderful aroma: fruit, sugar, malt.  Amazing colour and appearance, large off-white head with a red/brown almost black body.  Chimay Red breaks down a bit in the flavour, though, I find its a bit confused over what it wants to be.  Malt is buried deep inside the mix, while fruit flavours fade in and out.  A good beer, not great.  Certainly nowhere near the best of the Trappists.
",5
4990,"Pours a cloudy light brown with a nice sized head. Malty aroma but not all that malty when tasted. Smooth and medium bodied.
",5
4991,"(Bottle BBE 2010) Yeasty and fruity aroma. Red brown colour, hazy and light brown, large, slightly lasting head with good lacing. Yeasty, slightly sweet, fruity, slightly spicy and acidic flavour. Alcoholic (slightly), medium to full-bodied and fizzy carbonated palate. 04/11/06
",5
4992,"Pours a hazy reddish brown with very lively effervescence.  Head was creamy off-white color, not as thick as I had hoped but had excellent lacing.  Aroma of figs, dates and cloves well intertwined with barley malts and yeast.  Flavor is similar to the aroma, yielding to a more mellow, dry and spicy finish.  The velvety rich consistency complements the dark color of the beverage.  Had this with garlic ribs on a bed of california brown rice.  Made for a very well rounded meal.
",5
4993,"Reddish brown color with thick creamy head. Fairly dry and malty aroma with  tart fruitiness and hints of dates. Fruity and tart flavor with dates, raisins and clove. Raisins, pepper and clove in the finish. Higly carbonated. Well made and balanced but a bit dull.

4994,"Color is muddled amber, more malt than hop but balance is there...light carmel malt..mild brown sugar nose...some vegetal spice..sip it or glug it...its flexible
",5
4995,"Poured a nice warm toned brown, with a fluffy head.  Aroma was mellow, but significantly yeasty, with some nut, caramel, and fruit qualities.  Taste matched the aroma pretty much perfectly, but since the aroma was low-key, the taste is more intense.  The body of beer was medium but the carbonation made it feel incredibly fluffy.  Finished slightly dry, but not as much as expected.  Low hop bitterness.  A very smooth and well balanced abbey ale.  All others will be compared to this.
",5
4996,"Pours deep ruby brown with a rich, beige head.  Fizzy carbonation.  Aroma of banana and malt, with a fine, herbal hop bouquet.  Tastes of caramel malt and alcohol with a nice hop bite.  Excellent body but finishes clean.
",5
4997,"UPDATED: NOV 3, 2006 Pours a dark brown with a slightly orange glow. I assume this is bottle-conditioned, but I could not find any sediment. Perhaps I did not let it sit long enough before opening? Aroma is not too present - slightly sour, some sweetness and slightly medicinal. A very off-white head which settles to a beautiful soft foam. Wonderful crystal & light malt taste and completely transparent hopping. Slight alcohol taste but instantly smoothed over by sweet & sour aftertaste. Sourish tinge, but hardly overwhelming - nowhere near, say, a Grand Cru. WONDERFUL mouthfeel! Carbonation full and present at first, but disappears in the mouth leaving a liquid perfectly balanced in thickness. I prefer this to the Bluecap, at the moment. Fantastic beer!
",5
4998,"330ml bottle: Ive had this beer before, and maybe my tastes have just changed or maybe there was something wrong with the beer but it seemed watery - not in mouthfeel but in taste. The aroma was nice and its a beautiful looking beer in the proper glass, but the taste was simply sweet yeasty water. Disappointed this time around, but Ive got a 750ml bottle, and if its an improvement Ill re-rate this.

4999,"UPDATED: MAR 7, 2007 Another lovely belgian trappist beer, one of my favorites. A dark color and a long lasting finish.
",5
5000,"Chimay is always a win/win selection of beer. The Peres Trappistes 330ml poured hazy brick red/brown. Carbonation attacks the palate waking it up to the sweet belgian spice and malt which Immediately follows. Dont rush into this one, let it sit to the proper Abbey Dubbel temperature 54-57degrees to get all the flavors. Its well worth the wait.
",5
5001,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2008 750 ml bottle - pours a cloudy auburn with a gauzy head - you have to be really careful with the pour, especially if youre not using the proper glassware - otherwise its 90% head for a good while.  Aroma not as yeasty as I was expecting, more notes of pear and even peach.  Full-flavoured and fruity.  Flavours blossom in the mouth as the beer warms from its initial cellar temperature.  Long, dry, and slightly sour finish.  Nice.  Had this one back to back with a Westmalle dubbel, which was superior, at least  to my tastes.  Nonetheless, the Chimay Rouge is a beautiful beer.
",5
5002,"ahh nothing like the middle of the road!!! nice brown ruby colour, fruits malt, yeast floaters much better then the white well balanced. oh and for the sticklers available in Ontario at the LCBO and many fine beer bars... thanx
",5
5003,"Bottle at home. Deep brown color with big not lasting white head.  Nice trappist with not (for Belgium) too much alcohol.
",5
5004,"Bottle. Ruby color with medium lasting cream white head. Fruity malt and yeast aroma. Sweet malty flavour with notes off yeast.
",5
5005,"UPDATED: NOV 18, 2006 Bottle.		Pours a deep caramel brown with just a bit of fine sediment and a full if low-density head. The aroma is just marvellous - bready and spicy yeast, long caramel notes,  a hint of lemon. The flavor is very subtly sweet, slight cola notes, a hint of spice, a reasonable twist of hops into the finish, overall just a very balanced dubbel. The mouthfeel is on-target, amply carbonated, no alcohol burn.
",5
5006,"Opaque muddy copper pour with a quick dying head that wasnt too creamy. Sweet malt aroma with some fruit and spice too. Kinda weird palate, but still goes down well. I think I like it more than the blue.
",5
5007,"Not sure I can say much more than the others. A great dubbel that doesnt give of a lot of fusel alcohol aromas like many other beers in the same category.
",5
5008,"Nice opaque dark brown with a reddish hue. Big off-white head, which fades quickly Aroma is a bit grassy, with spice and fruityness. Taste is  unremarkable and dry with bready carbonation. $3.50/11.2oz
",5
5009,"The beer pours a hazy dark brown with orange highlights - and a thin off-white head. The aroma smells of sweet malts, fruit (figs, prunes), hints of spice, and yeast. The flavor has strong carbonation zip that almost bites the tongue The beer starts with a little sweetness and a little acid. The full taste of malts and hints of hops enter in the middle. There is an interesting combination of chocolate, fruit., and yeast. The beer finishes malty, but dry and light with a lingering aftertaste of yeast, malts, and hops (in that order).
",5
5010,"Pours to a hazy reddish brown, with off-white head that lingers thru most of the glass and reduces to decent lacing. Had a nice, pleasant aroma of dark fruit and malty sweetness. Taste was marked by just enough carbonation to add some zing, to the malty sweet dary fruit. About 3/4 thru, the 7% alcohol began kicking in, and this all led to a long, warming finish. I really enjoyed this beer.
",5
5011,"UPDATED: DEC 21, 2006 The beer pours a hazy reddish brown with flashes of a garnet-red. Pour produced a massive, fluffy, creamy off-white head.  Nose of malt with a sweet and a strong spicy note, yeasty with hints of plums and raisins and just a hint of herbaceous hops. Silky mouth-feel with a crisp champagne-like carbonation and a medium body. Flavors reflect aroma with a heavy clove flavor initially which persists throughout the drinking session. Malts and caramel along with chocolate and dark toffee. Dried fruit notes call to mind figs and plums. Finish is fairly dry with a balanced bitterness. Excellent!
",5
5012,"750ml cork top bottle from the LCBO.  This is an absolutely incredible beer, period.  I had read some bad things about the ""mass market"" style that Chimay has taken, but as far as Im concerned its just a story, and the beer speaks for itself!  It pours a wonderful dark auburn brown, with golden molasses tones when held to light.  The head is thick, and lasts the whole glass through, leaving a very nice fine lacing.  The smell is sweet and crisp, with strong bread dough notes, yeast, and some fruit that is hard to place.  The taste is exquisite, and so balanced that its remarkable.  Its bold in all aspects, like a trappist should be, but no heavy alcohol taste or smell.  The aftertaste is exactly as it should be; a subdued version of the initial taste.  The balanced nature of the beer lets you pick out little subtleties in the aftertaste that make every sip another adventure, even after youve had it several times.  This beer is so solid, and so balanced, that it should be used as a benchmark to judge other trappist beers.  I know there are better trappist beers out there, but this is the best baseline Ive run across.  If you havent tried this beer yet, make it your next one!

5013,"I had my doubts. In the back of my bald head i refused an once of credit to chimay...until i downed a pint of this!		Pure heaven my sons......
",5
5014,"Ruby with medium lasting cream white head. Fruity malt and yeast aroma. Sweet malty flavour with all the yeast notes and the slightest hint of bitterness.

5015,"Beautiful Copper color with thick white head.  Extensive lacing and wonderful aroma (strong enough to taste).  Smooth palate belies higher alcohol content.  All in all a great beer.

5016,"Slighty fruitty, quite yeasty. Simply one of the nicest with nice smell. Sweet ending. Just try it ...
",5
5017,"UPDATED: SEP 21, 2010 Copper color with a full head. Aroma is a little fruity, some berries, but mostly bready malt aroma. Flavor is pretty yeasty, slightly hoppy, and ""old"" tasting. Delicious...
",5
5018,"UPDATED: JAN 31, 2008 Murky chesnut specimen in requisite goblet. Dirtily creamy marbled suds. Sourly yeasty nose after the pour, softening into prunes and boozy caramel. Milkily creamy palate without a trace of alcohol. If anything, this beer is just too neutral and smooth, and slips inoffensively down without developing any really distinct flavours. Wheres the finish? Wheres the hops? Its all watery malt and milky caramel. Smells fantastic, but not as tasty or balanced as the last beer I sampled (Bitburger Pils). (Re-rate, 01/02/08) Some hops, earthy yeast and Trappist character, which is surprising. But too much stale cardboard. Gentle liquorice bitterness to finish. Thin and papery/ashy like Leffe. Even smells of cardboard. Different to last time, but still mediocre, even for a bog standard dubbel.
",5
5019,"the first trappist i ever had, deep brown color, light wispy head, great lacing.  i drank it too cold which muted too many of the flavors, spice and dried fruits, cherries.  really opened my eyes to the world of belgian beers.

5020,"Dark brown, creamy ample head with lots of carb. Smells of caramel, yeast and bananas. Rough and creamy with a pronounced malt aftertaste.

5021,"Seems that my Chimay reviews have dissappeared for the second time!  I dont know whats going on in the database.  Regardless, I like the red best of all of the Chimay Ales.  Good body and great tangy sour wheat flavor.

5022,"De basic beer from Chimay. Light brown color with a large white head. Aroma is yeasty and malty. Flavor is very much the same with a bit of fruityness to it. 	OKAY.
",5
5023,"Bottle: Red brown color with a lovely off-white, bubbly head.  Strong aromas of yeast, alcohol, fermented corn silage, and sour milk.  Ripe bananas can be found in the taste along with yeast and plastic -- all malts.  The body is about medium and leaves a thin film in your mouth.  I think this is the least favorite of the three Chimay colors.
",5
5024,"Coppery and hazy colour with a very compact thick white head. Light but nice aroma of hop and caramalt. Medium bodied. Very nice aftertaste.
",5
5025,"Bottle at Melting Pot in Montgomery.  Obviously a very good beer but the aroma and flavor were a bit lacking - just never really came through for me. From the appearance I expected a bigger bolder taste.  All that being said - very smooth and rich in the mouth - velvety.  Beautiful appearance and a great looking foamy head.
",5
5026,"This was my first contact witht he Trappist beers.  I took a big swig after complaining about the super massive foamy head I got no matter how I poured it.  I felt like I got ran overthere was so much going on.  It was then I realized the ""Burgundies of Belgium"" were something different.

5027,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2008 Bottled, 75cl champagne-cork. Orange-brown and hazy-looking with a small head. Cellar, caramel, spices and some hops in the aroma. The flavor is quite sweet, with roasted malt, caramel and candi-sugar. Full-bodied beer that disappointed me a bit, comparing to the blue and white Chimays, but definately a good beer. Rating: 7-4-7-4-14-3.6.(060819)Bottle, 33cl. It pours an orange-brown, unclear body under a really creamy, beige, fingerthick head. The aroma is lovely, but maybe a bit one-tracked. Dark sugars and dried fruit, mostly sultanas, run the show, leaving some place for a yeast note. Some ripe blue plums as well. Its quite full-bodied and slightly warming in the mouth, with flavors of dried fruits, ripe blue plums and sugars. Some caramel too, and its quite effervescent. Good bitterness in the finish, which else has the same flavors found initially. A really good beer that I find a bit hard to rate. Its one of those beers I want to give 7.5 on both aroma and flavor, but lacking that option, I raised the overall by 1 extra point. A beer to return to. (080818)

5028,"This is just the right Belgian taste, but safe.  Id love to go to Chimay, though, and have it in the place where it began.	Very aromatic with longlasting thick head

5029,"Poured a dark amber.  Complex palate which is satisfying.  A nice beer to savour - alcohol content is not overpowering.  Not the best Chimay of the 3  in my humble opinion.
",5
5030,"Simply put, Chimay is classy. Even non craft beer Savants will appreciate a Chimay whether it is the Red White or Blue. Personally, I prefer the Blue and I would not call this beer (the Red) one of my favorites, there are so many other classy beers for celebratory occasions; but this one does have its time and place. 		Appearance: Served in my goblet the appearance is party translucent (but not transparent) amber / brown, with a decent head and nice lacing. 		Smell: The smell is sweet & malty with suggestions of caramel and plums. It also has some fruity characteristics and hints of yeast. 		Taste & Mouthfeel: This beer is very carbonated. It is sweet and bubbly in the mouth. The taste seems a bit straightforward and simple for a Dubbel. It is pleasant but not extremely exciting. Sweet malts and flavors of dark fruits and caramel sugars dominate the mouth. The hop notes are very subtle but present. It is very crisp. Maybe the high carbonation is partly responsible for the thinness in the taste. As it sits and warms the over carbonation fades and its best aspect seems to be the sweet aftertaste that lingers in your mouth for a very long time. Nice.		Drinkability: For a simple bubbly beer this is a great choice for graduation parties and anniversaries with a wide variety of drinkers. It is simple enough on the palate that few people will find it objectionable. It will successfully accompany a wide variety of food selections and it goes down very easily. So, like I said before, Chimay Premire (Red) does have its time and place.		Hope this is helpful.	Cheers!

5031,"11.2 oz. bottle. Deep hazy amber and mahogany color, nearly opaque, huge light-tan head. Fresh floral and herbal aroma, yet quite subdued. Taste is bitter, earthy, with a bit of astringency. Complex, maybe a little messy? Dry finish. Weird aftertaste is reminding me of mold, just a little bit. Its been a while since Ive had a Chimay product, and I remember liking them better. Anyway, this brew is fine, but many other Belgian ales are more exciting. Try the small bottle first.

5032,"As advertised... very silky going down, bitter in the end.  Was hoping for more complexity... seems a bit mild for my liking.  Have had before, but will have to try again.

5033,"33cl. Dark Amber color with a great aroma a very clean crisp spicy brew. The fruity aromas where wonderful this is a very good brew and would love to visit the acutal brewery one day.

",5
5035,"750 corked n caged bottle 2010 vintage- The cork popped out like a champagne cork, massively pressurized- Pours cloudy dark orange with a suprisingly thin head and poor lacework. The aroma makes up for the appearance, its Belgian sugar, yeast, banana, and tart. The flavor is also sugar, not too tart, figs, banana, clove, smooth and sessionable. The body is full to medium, carbonation is high. Overall I was kind of let down, there is no denying this is a world class beer, but I have to admit I had higher expectations.

5037,"Belgians are always unique beers.I cant beleive i havent tried this or the blue yet but have tried many others and has been a while.If anybody was new to these they would be surprised how good complex and differnt beer can taste.Even though it reminds me of wine somewhat its very pleasing in taste aroma and effect.I respect a beer that can age well is unpasterized and healthier has a unique taste and never that weird yeast aroma that i find in many good and reputable ipas.The aroma is great complex smelling of sweet grain fruit, cherrry maybe some other dark berry overall a unique smell you will never smell until experiencing this.Taste is similar with dark cherry like smooth malt sweetness.Sweet and somewhat dry barely sticky.	 Color was brownish red and hazy from the yeast.Not big in head but carbonated well.Finishes with a faint tart fruit like mildly spicyness all balanced.Giving your mouth a big party of flavor.Cant wait to try that blue!	 Screw those cherry stouts or fruity flavored beers this is the real kind of fruit that wont turn you off like those.Coming from someone that does not like any of those fruit type beers too.

5038,"(Bottle, 0.33 l - BBE 2014, at Hilpe Hauki, Helsinki, 20110527) The beer poured copper coloured and quite clear. Its head was medium sized and white.

Aftertaste was malty and bitter. Balanced and ok.

5042,"Bottle. Poured a nice reddish amber with a fairly decent head that dissapated quickly. This is similar in style to the Bleu however this one has more of a fruity and nutty character to it. The alcohol content doesnt become noticeable at first take. A good beer but I like the Bleu a lot more.

Begins lightly malty with tones of lightly sweet carmel, gives way to a citrusy fruit flavor with a fair amount of yeasty spice. Finishes dry and spicy with a lasting yeast presence.
",5
5046,"Chimay is the perfect default beer. Youre in a store, you want something good, you dont know what to buy (if youre a novice), get the Chimay. Its just the right Belgian taste, but safe. In San Francisco, you get it on tap. Id love to go to Chimay, though, and have it in the place where it began.

5047,"Pours a dark copper with a nice white head.  Aromas of belgian yeasts, fruit, and a little caramel.  Flavors of sweet malt, belgian yeast, fruit, spices, and a hint of caramel.  Finishs with a little alcohol bite.  Not as good as blue, but still worth trying.

5050,"750ml bottle, 7% a/v (My first beer with a cork! :-) )		Pours a cloudy ruby/chocolate colour with a dense offwhite head. Honey and cinammon in the nose with a smell of almost some sweet fruit liquor. Taste is somewhat alcoholic with a strong fruit presence, a nice spicy aftertaste on the tongue leaves you longing for another sip.. Definetly a nice beer when you wanna spoil yourslef.

5051,"The cork said 01/05, so I assume that this one is a year and a hlf old - Ive had it in the basemenet for 8 months.  About a half inch, light-brown head that mostly diminished.  Color was a nice brown.	Aroma was light malt, bread, yeast and a little roasted.  Taste was thin and there really wasnt much to it. Not much matliness that I wouldve expected.  Carbonation was still lively, but it had a bit of a metallic taste.  I think I need to find a freash one of these and compare.

",5
5056,"A thick, foamy head results in a dense layer of bubbles on the surface of the beer.  The aroma was predominantly wheat, malt, and a general fruitiness (raisins, dates, apricots, citrus).  Flavors were a complex blend of malt, yeast, caramel, dried fruits (dates, raisins), citrus (orange, lemon), some general spiciness, and some slight hint of hops in the finish.  Really great, one of the greatest dubbels without question...

",5
5059,"Very good all around trappist-ale. Nice pour (in proper glass) with a nice fruit smell and light bubbly head.  Sweet taste, but a little weaker than the blue (the preferred brew).  Overall a nice, light-ish, widely available belgian ale.
",5
5060,"Aromas of floral hops, hay, straw and cassis. Pours a hazy reddish brown with an off-white head that is quickly diminishing.  Initial flavor is a bright hop bitterness with a hint of malt sweetness that opens to a spicy flavor that reminds me of flank steak grilled on a flat top. Finishes with a nice well balanced hop bitterness. Will try this with grilled beef next time.
",5
5061,"I love this beer when I am grilling out some filet mingons. I love the almost sparkling bubble/light bitter feeling when I take the 1st sip. Nice head on it however it seems to disappear pretty quick. Nice lightly soured finish to this reddish colored brew.

5066,"""This was my first Chimay, and I have to admit that I was dissapointed. It pours a nice dark brown color with a hint of orange or red. The head was thin, a very slight tan color to it. The aroma was spicy and fruity at the same time. Maybe a pear aroma mixed in with the spices. The mouthfeel was nice, very full and definitely complex. I tasted a mostly floral type of taste with the spices overpowering any of the fruity flavors involved. It has a slightly bitter aftertaste. Very drinkable, but not all I expected after hearing so much about this beer.""

5067,"Quickly becoming a frequent style for me... Another Abbey Dubbel... Dark brown body with fairly thick, slowly dissipating tan head.  Smells malty and slightly sweet.  Tasty, but not as overwealming as some Dubbels.  Fairly well-balanced.  Definitely can taste the hops and fruit influences.  A decent beer, definitely can see me drinking this again.

5068,"33cl bottle Nose is of caramelly malt with a little apricots; Hazy rusty amber body with a little bit of an off-white head. Flavor is of caramel with a little hop bitterness and more hops in the finish

5072,"UPDATED: OCT 22, 2006 11.2oz bottle, no date.  Pours a hazy reddish brown with a large light beige head into my Chimay glass.  Aroma of dusty raisins, brown sugar, slightly herbal--the aroma isnt very strong, and I cant blame the temperature because this has been sitting out for quite a while.  The taste isnt strong, either.What is there is a very creamy, very soft carbonated  beer with slight bitterness.  Dusty raisins again, some herbal notes and a little bit of spicy hops.There is also some brown sugar.  Kinda nice in that the flavor doesnt kick you in the face--everything is subtle about this beer.		During my rerate, the flavors seem more apparent, even though it is a bit colder.  I think my only change is bumping overall from 16 to 17.
",5
5073,"UPDATED: AUG 26, 2006 Loved the bottle, the presentation, the trappist glass, the pour . . . everything but the beer itself.  I can say it was good, but it underperformed too-high expectations.  The soda-like carbonation dominated the tasting and I largely missed out on the other qualities.  Il need to re-rate as I gain greater sampling of similar highly rated beers.
",5
5074,"Bottled. Pours a hazy orange amber with large but diminishing white head. Nearly explosive carbonation. The taste is cloves, toffee. I need to re-rate this one when I more focused on the task at hand.
",5
5075,"UPDATED: JUL 4, 2006 700mL Bottle. First off I love the fact that this bottle had a cork in it. Poured a deep red-brown, slightly cloudy with a thick white head. Aroma of sweet honey and plums. It was well carbonated. Taste starts sweet with fruits and carmels, lots of grains, and yeast flavour with a hint of carmels and finishes with a slightly dry bitterness. Another nice product of Belguim.

5077,"Bottle. Chestnut brown with a rich, creamy offwhite head. Sweet caramel aroma with some spicy hoppiness. Flavours start sweet, but with well-balanced bitterness. Flowery hop flavours. Warming alcohol, full body, good carbonation. A well-made craft beer that lacks a little punch.

5078,"Chimay has a very thin body. It pours cloudy red and has a good but not too strong taste.
",5
5079,"In the 750 mL bottle at the 2006 Huber Haus Belgian Trappist Ale Tasting. Pours a cloudy rust red with a thick pillowy off white head consisting of fine bubbles. The aroma is not very strong- faint raisins and berries. Has a sweet mild chemical rings the tongue. Astringent and drying at the end. Has a thinner body than I expected. The finish is a mild bitterness, but rather drying from the mild tartness.
",5
5080,"UPDATED: DEC 31, 2008 pours deep brown with a nice head that lasts for much of the way down the glass. aroma of light hops, malt, and spice.  flavor is very well balanced: yeast, malt, hops, belgium sugar and spices with a hint of fruit.  there seems to be an astringent hop and malt note to it, thats subtle but annoying.  rated blind from ""Better Know a Style: Abbey Dubbel"" tasting. Pours a brown orange with a beige head.  Nose of grains and fruity but very slight.  Old grain, fruity, alcohol, and paper flavors.  Really dry and not good.  These chimays always score low in our blind tastings. 6/3/5/2/9 = 2.5

5081,"Pours a deep brown color with a large white head.  Aroma is yeasty and malty.  Flavor is very much the same with a bit of fruityness to it.

5082,"Bottle, 330ml. A cloudy dark amber-coloured pour with a huge frothy diminishing head. Aromas of sweet honey and plum with a hint of bread/dough. A hoppy taste with toffee and biscuity hints. Alcohol is quite noticable. A light hoppy, fruity finish with some harshness from the alcohol. Very high carbonation. A complex brew, but the carbonation ruined it for me.

5083,"Hazy dark amber with a nice soapy head. Lt. hops with a green spice flavor reminiscent of cloves. Better than the White, but not as good as the Blue.
",5
5084,"The aroma is a combination of spices, hops, and fruit.  The pour is a murky brown with a tan head.  The spiceness of the hops accompanied by a dry fruitiness is well balanced.

5086,"UPDATED: JUL 12, 2006 hazy brown with medium head.  Really rich taste with nice apricot highlights.  Aroma is spiced and apricots and plums.  I was suprised by the level of bitterness in the beer, but it really balanced the beer well.  Nice sweetness to the beer.
",5
5087,"UPDATED: NOV 27, 2006 Bottle chimay premiere 75 cl  of 1999. Gentlemen, what a year, and such a good beer. Poors a hazy brown beer with a minor head, and some pleasant lacing. Aromas of sweet malts are noticed. Flavors like plums, caramel, ending into sweetness, and fruitiness.
",5
5088,"Pours a cloudy brown with no head. Lots of sediment in the bottle. A bit of mellow sweetness in the nose. Nothing particularly wrong with it, just not a whole lot to get excited about. Complexity leaves something to be desired. Rather a bland, boring beer. Was expecting something much bette for $4 a bottle.

5090,"Finally rated this one.  I like the blue so much, it is hard to want to buy the red.  A clear brownish-orange pour, large creamy off-white head.  Hints of sweet in the nose with a nice noble hop spiciness and breadiness.  Lovely mouthfeel, tastes of sweet malts and spice balanced with decided nuttiness.  Delicate, yet complex.  A lovely dubbel.

5091,"Bottle Conditioned, 330 ml, Aged 5.5yrs. Tawny with light head.Saved this rating for an aged beer and boy did I enjoy it. The smoothness was supreme with a thick mouthfeel and a juicy fruitiness. Enjoyed this while watching England in the World cup and although it was a nervy second half against Paraguay with a dodgy Mexican Referee both the beer and team were winners. I hope this doesnt re open the new vs old Chimay arguments, but this was a belter, just like Becks free kick.
",5
5092,"750 mL bottle. Poured dark brown with a solid off tan head. A nice drink, with small hints of sweetness that I could not really place. I may have to try this one again because it seemed to be hiding more flavor that I could not seem to taste.

5094,"330ml bottle brought back to the arctic north from a supermaked in Crete!. Cloudy brown. Beige head. Fruity and sourish aroma. Milk caramel flavour profile with a rummy touch. Slight bitterness in the end. Crispated.Well rounded taste, but though a bit too sweet.
",5
5095,"Probably my least favorite in the Chimay line-up but still a great beer. Appearance is a nice darker brown color with floaties present, it looks quite good. Typical Belgian esters pull through with a good spice bite to it, but this one is just not as complex as other dubbels... a little bit average but when youre talkin Belgian beers average is still very good!
",1
5096,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2007 Summed rating for two experiences (5/05 and 8/07): Nice smooth dubbel. Poured a dark slightly cloudy brown color with a nice head that didnt leave. The aroma was spicey and plum like. Alcohol was very tame and the flavor was true to the style and aroma with some candy sugar detectable. Nice spice-dark fruit interplay, yeasty, bready, dry touch to the finish. Mouthfeel was carbonated with a medium body. Dubbels are nice, but not that impressive anymore.
",5
5097,"Very balanced brew with a hint of sweetness.  Beautiful amber color, creamy head with a slightly dry finish.
",5
5098,"This is my favorite beer.  I love the brown-amber cloudiness, the burning/warming feel of 7% alcohol, and the sweetness that develops in the finish.  I can smell light toasted maltiness, red wine, and floral scents combined with heavier syrup and alcohol aromas.  For me, the flavor and mouthfeel lift this dubbel above its competitors.  I enjoy its soft to lively carbonation, medium to full body, and moderately alcoholic finish.  Chimay Reds sweetness and bitterness are in near-perfect balance.

5099,"A nice pour from the start, fruity, slightly bitter, nice spiciness to it, a great drinking beer, not my favorite from Chimay, but still a world class brew.

5100,"Little fat bottle, i think i got a sour one. It was all metalic, start to finish. The apearance was beautiul amber woody with a whipped cream topping. The flavor was like sucking a penny. A faint backgrounk of dried fruits overwhelmed by copper. Highly sulfuric and astringent finish, completly dry with little bitterness. Dont know whats up, this is the second time ive had this brew. Bought at Bevmo Mission valley. Bad beer or Burnt Beer?

5102,"A absolutely great trappist that I drink quite often. A very complex beer, I enjoy it more than the blue.

5103,"I have scoured the world and found no better beer. Complexity abounds. There is a distinctly different start, middle, and finish which  goes through sweet, dry, fruity, bitter, and malt.
",5
5104,"From my notes, February 06. 330ml bottle. Dark reddish brown color with a thick head that lasted through the whole drinking experience. Spicy aroma with hints of yeast and malt. Light alcohol presence, taste of dough and dried fruit. Malty and yeasty undertones. Better than Chimay White IMO, but no match for Blue.
",5
5105,"Pours a dark reddish-brown color with a thick off-white head.  Aroma is of sweet malts, dried fruit, spices, and caramel.  Flavor starts off with the sweet malts that give way to the dried fruit and spices.  Flavor lingers awhile.  A pretty tasty brew but not my favorite from Chimay.
",5
5106,"Poured amber in color with tall light tan head and typical Belgium level of carbonation (medium-high). Spicy yeasty  hoppy aroma with a bit of malt. Taste is a balance of sweet malts and spice influence that initially gives it a slight medicine taste. The following tastes had more fruit notes like grapes and cherries. It ends with a nice light malty aftertaste.

5107,"Pours a cloudy blood orange into a Chimay glass.  Dried fruit notes.  Lively and full.  Spicy with a dry, slightly metallic aftertaste.

5109,"Bottle - May 2006		Pour an opaque, slightly hazy copper-brownish colour with a nice creamy beige head that leaves a beatifull lace. Aroma is yeasty, of dried fruits, sweet. Taste is dry, a bit thin, simple, easrthy, sugary, refreshing, but not quite I was looking in this brew
",5
5110,"Corked Bottle.	Subtle sweet aroma escapes.	Decent belgian appearance.	Flavor is good with not much character.	Palate keeps you drinking.	A good Dubbel but I expect more from Chimay, this ale should be better.

5111,"Pours murky copper, with a somewhat fruity-yeasty aroma.  Starts with sourdough bread, caramel, alted milballs and sunshine.  Solid finish.  A nice belgian - but maybe a little too sour.
",5
5112,"11.2 oz bottle.  Garnet colored; small suspended particles make it somewhat cloudy.  White head settles to a flat sunny-side up.  Vinous nose; a bit of banana and prune.  Sweet toffee quickly fades to mild lemon and then carrot juice.  Soapy?  Medium body, medium carb.  Nicely even but not memorable.
",5
5113,"11.20oz bottle, pours cloudy brown.	Soap-sud head with multiple size bubbles that stick around.  Carbonation has a bit of a sharp bite.  Very slight smokeyness to this beer.  Was good, but I expected more from the Monks.	$3/bottle in Boca Raton

5114,"Appears a murky brown with a small, 1 finger off-white head that stays around forever. Scattered lacing is left around the glass.	Smell is of mild cocoa, candy sugar, gentle caramel, vanilla, along with yeasty dough.	Taste is of the same aromas in the classic Chimay style.	Mouthfeel is smooth, caramely, sugary, with creamy vanilla sliding along the tongue. Very clean with sugary vanilla esters and light caramel standing up to the challenge.

5116,"If ""sweet love"" had a flavor, this would be it. The monks have done us a solid with their Chimay products, this one in particular.  Smooth like velvet with hints of rusty figs and smooth pine cones.  This stuff is always on sale at Trader Joes.  Love it.  Perfect Belgian ale.

5120,"Appearance - Orange/red brown hazy, frothy white head quickly dissapates, minimal lacing on glass. Aroma - Fruity, some bread yeast, spicy, some alcohol, perfumy wheat, floral malt. Quite complex aroma.	Taste - Malt,  hint of spices, alcohol, wheat, slight acidic sourness (not unpleasant), a layer of sweetness. Spicy alcoholic warming malt finish with light bitterness.	The lively carbonation suits the beer. A very good beer (91/100) but Chimay Blue surpasses it as one of the megastars.
",5
5121,"330ml bottle from Alko		Pours copperish red with a large foamy head. Aroma has hints of yeast and spices. Taste is malty and has hints of caramel. Slightly sweet and sour finish. Not very complex, but well balanced.
",5
5122,"Had a bottle at the Trappistenlokaal in Delft. You would expect that a bar this dedicated to beer and especially to trappist ales, would serve it a the right temperature. Too bad the bartender served it way to cold, so most of the aroma wasnt noticeable. Had to warm the glass up between my hands to bring it to temperature. Colour was ok, looking reddish brown with a hazy glow in it. When the aroma came back eventually, it had some forest fruits like berries, abricots and really fruity yeasts. It has a really subtle body, full and round, easy to drink. Flavour is full, sugar sweetness and small hints of chocolate. Nice one.
",5
5123,"330 mL bottle in a Chimay glass of course...  Finally finishing out the Chimay trifecta until I make it over to the brewery.  Although, this is the first of the three I have had, it has been almost 9 years since the last time I had one.  Hazy amber pour with a medium head.  Malty caramel and fruit aroma.  Rich fruity flavors with a nice hop balance.  Still as good as I remember from the first time.
",5
5124,"It poured a reddish brown color with a cloudy head. The aroma was raisins, spice, plum, citrus and malts. The taste was about the same as the aroma.  A very good trio of beers.
",5
5125,"copper colour with great creamy head on top. apricot and cherry aromas with some more frutiness and yeast. sweet balanced taste,very refreshing and pleasant to drink.
",5
5126,"0.33l botttle. Pours a cloudy light brown body with a red hue, lots of black sediments and a big fluffy off-white head. Aroma is light fruity, some yeast, malty, light sugar candy and some mild plums. Body is mild and smooth, mildly carbonated and has a slick, watery and vanishing mouthfeeling. Nice and sweet flavors with some brown caramel, malts, ripe strawberries and ends with a little alcohol finish and a lightly sour aftertaste. Quite low on the bitterness. Nice indeed.
",5
5127,"Bottle from Swedish ""Systembolaget"".Brown color, brown head. Belgian beer scent. Very metallic taste.I love the Blue Chimay, but the red one is just not glass of beer at all.
",1
5128,"Dark amber color, brownd and persistent foam.	Fantastic aroma, caramel, malt, porto, some caf andf fruit notes; mice beer!!!
",5
5129,"caramel, amber, hazy, frothy, tan foam, light sweetness, lightly sour, medium bitterness, light body, thin feel, fizzy,
",5
5130,"11.2 oz bottle at Bonaventure Lounge, LA.  Dark brown/amber cloudy body with a very nice inch+ white head.  Slightly sweet caramel aroma.  Flavors of yeast, caramel and a very nice spiciness.  Finish seemed a bit weak.  I know I missed something because it was served way too cold (typical) and I didnt have enough time to let it warm.  A very nice beer.
",5
5131,"[Bottle - Old Chicago - Beaverton, Oregon]	Dark Amber color with a great aroma a very clean crisp spicy brew.  The fruity aromas where wonderful this is a very good brew and would love to visit the acutal brewery one day.
",5
5132,"Bottle. Dark amber color, full head. A mild spiciness coupled with yeasty and fruity aromas. A smooth drinking ale, with up front yeast aroma. Mild bite. Very good beer.
",5
5133,"Bottle sampled with Stegosaurus. Pours a reddish color with a decent fluffy heady aromas of fruit, belgian style spices and sweetness, taste is of smoothness, carbonation, fruit, and spices. decent brew.
",1
5134,"Not bad - But not great....Bitter and carbonated. Nice Reddish/brown appearance - very foamy head.  Fruity and spicy -- This beer can definetly stand up for its self.
",1
5135,"Bottle. Reddish brown with large brownish head. Very sparkly. Sweet and malty. Notes of dried fruit. A bit to mild though.
",1
5136,"11.2 oz bottle - Pours reddish brown with a big, foamy head.  The aroma is light and fruity.  The flavor strikes a nice balance between the malt sweetness and some bitterness, along with very apparent fruit notes.  The palate is very lively and smooth, though it could stand to be a little more full.  The finish is dry.  This is a very good beer.  Though at four bucks for a small bottle being easily the best price Ive found on it, Id like to see something a bit more full and complex.
",5
5137,"I like the white and blue better but the coppoery cololr and balanced palate make it a decent pick.
",5
5138,"UPDATED: JUN 24, 2007 red brown with creamy white head. Like the other chimays it has a lively carbonation. Defenetly a bit like the bleu but not as complex. It feels like a  little bit less of everything. Ok finish!  Re-rating june 07: 2001 bottle enjoyed at a quiet pub in Venezia: Muddy brown with good head. COMPLEX - Dark sweet fruits, malty, light alcohol, pleasant warmth, port notes - light spice. This experience was fantastic!
",5
5139,"Poors golden brown with a pebbly head.  Drinks easily despite its high ABV.  I found the red and white versions indistiguishable.
",1
5140,"red brown color, foamy head, Medium bodied and wonderfully smooth velvety well balanced bitter-sweet-alcohol palate from start to finish, some woody flavours in there as well. Lighter flavoured than both the Blue or White but still a great beer in its own right. I think I prefer it over both the Blue or White
",5
5141,"A fine beer, true, but overrated.  Not much in the way of aromas (fruity esters, to be sure, but muted).  Silky smooth.  Copper colored.  Nicely bodied with just a hint of astringency.  Good, but there are better .........
",1
5142,"While I have found the experience of drinking a Chimay enjoyable, the product itself I believe to be somewhat overrated IMO. The beer is well done, no doubt. But there are better examples of this style. Anyways, on to the review. The aroma was fruity sweet, spicy, although not very complex. Appearance was a nice copper color that looked very nice in my glass. Mouthfeel was a bit fizzy and hot. Flavors werent too deep either with notes of caramel, dark fruit, some hops and malty sweet. Enjoyable, but like the Chimay Blue, a tad overrated.
",5
5143,"UPDATED: JUN 6, 2006 Pours lighter than the Bleue, taste and scent is not as strong - a softer version i think, similar in taste but subtler and perhaps less complex. Very easy to drink, very nice.
",5
5144,"75cl bottle, tasted blind in a flight of 8 dubbels(this turned out to be the second beer of the tasting).  Reddish/brown color, bubbly head.  Very carbonated, very thin & dry.  Earthy(reminds me of seawater somehow) very muted aroma...maybe a little peppery.  very dry, and a bit of roughness in the finish...body is almost non-existant...slight fruitiness shows up here and there, but this really lacks any redeeming character.
",1
5145,"UPDATED: APR 7, 2006 33cl bottle.  Bottle conditioned.  Pours a murky dark amber / brown.  (I poured a decent amt. of the dregs, I just couldnt bear to leave too much beer in the bottle.)  ~1cm tan head that dissipated quickly into a nice layer of foam.  Great spicy, fruity, distinctly belgian aroma.  (I am pretty new to belgians, so I dont have a better way of describing it yet.)  I would assume Im getting some esters and cloves.  Flavor doesnt necessarily live up to what I expected out of the aroma.  Just doesnt seem to be all that complex.  Just a kind of bitter with a distinct belgian aftertaste, but doesnt seem to be a ton there.  A little yeasty and herby.  Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and light.  Its good, but for the price there has to be much better dubbels out there.  I do have to add that the flavor did get a little better and more complex as the beer warmed.  The last sip was better than the first.  Lesson learned.
",1
5146,"very middle of the road. big quickly dissapating head. brown with red showing in the light. yeasty wheaty almost pasta like aroma. very creamy mouthfeel. lightly sweet lightly bitter.
",1
5147,"This is definitely not as exciting as the other Trappist offerings Ive had. Its not bad, but its definitely lacking complexity and texture. Pours a hazy medium red-amber color with a very large, frothy, off-white, quickly diminishing and mostly lasting head. The aroma is malty with moderate notes of toasted grain; hoppy with a light note of herbs and a trace note of lemon zest; yeasty with heavy notes of bread dough and light notes of damp basement; trace notes of orange zest, raw sugar. spicy alcohol. The flavor is moderately bitter, moderately sweet and lightly acidic with a longer-than-average, heavily alcohol, lightly bittersweet finish. Kind of an ichy soap/astringent aftertaste. The body is light, the texture is watery and the carbonation is average.
",1
5148,"Poured in a Trappist glass.  Very cloudy copper color with a medium off-white head.  Light yet complex aroma of apricot, banana, and maybe some dark fruit, as well as some caramel malt and some spice.  Flavor is caramelly, fruity, and just a little salty.  Fairly fizzy mouthfeel and a long finish of malty caramel and some bitterness.  I like this about as much as the other Chimays, just in a different way.
",5
5149,"Had a 75cl bottle. Brown colour, with some red touches and an average, off white head. Sweet aroma, light caramal hints and fruity-spicy. Full body with a creamy finish, light bitter. Very good beer, I love it.
",5
5150,"Bottle. I used to drink this once in a while a few years back. However in the meantime I have tried thousands of beers and as such I was prepared to be disappointed. It was pretty good thought. Huge, fluffy head on a chestnut brown hazy body. Aroma is hoppy with notes of alcohol. Quite bitter and dry in the mouth with clear notes of hops and caramel. Slightly unpleasant metallic finish. Pretty good.
",5
5151,"Head quickly diminishes on this one, but leaves an awesome look in the glass... nice yeasty dark haze, with plenty of yummy yeast particles floating around.  Light melon and apricot to the nose, and the flavor is a bit lighter than I would have expected.  Does not contain the same round mouthfeel as the Blue Label, a bit more fizzy and ""light"" in comparison.  There are notes of caramel and fruit, sizzling from the front of the pull through the finish.  Hops, however insinuated, blend well into the brew.  I agree with some others (""alabamajohn"" below, for instance), this has a definite champagne mouthfeel - almost exactly the same.  It goes down well, without the complexity of its big brother.  Still a good offering here... sorry if I made too many references to the Blue Label, as I rated this Red Label right after it..... maybe a mistake in retrospect.
",5
5152,"I like the champagne mouthfeel of Chimays brews.  This one is light on flavor, however.  Trappist light?  Good to give to friend who arent serious beer lovers.
",5
5153,"330ml bottle. Reasonable head that subsides slowly. Certainly an unusual aroma to this beer, somewhere between a malt cellar and a damp dog, though that isnt necessarily a bad thing. As for the taste, quite a deep earthy taste, lacking the bitter, fruity tang of some belgian beers; though again, this isnt a bad thing. Eminently drinkable with an almost caramelised aftertaste.
",5
5154,"Hard to not compare this to the blue... so I wont try.  A very great beer.  Really the main thing I think this lacks from the Blue is the great mouth feel the blue has, the alcohol tingle, without the alcohol taste.
",5
5155,"Tt olutta pystyy juomaan sujuvasti. Maku on paljon miedompi kuin sinisess Chimayss.
",5
5156,"330 ml bottle.  Good carbonation.  Fruity / malty aroma.  Cloudy.  Smooth taste, easy to drink.  Great beer
",5
5157,"Pours a cloudy, nutty, iced tea brown.  Tan, two finger frothy head diminishes to a tan film with pronounced center as carbonation comes up from the center in the Trappist glass.  A medium palate with a slightly oily texture with lively small carbonation.  Leaves a very full, even lacing that lingers for a moment before descending the walls of the glass.  Aroma is a slightly sweet spice with a nutty background  not terribly strong. Initial banana sweetness was a surprise, then goes into a profound choco-nut, autumn spices and clove linger to the finish.  Maybe cassis as well?  Has a very pleasant mild spicy bite to it. Barely a trace of bitterness to add balance.  A truly great beer.  Loved every second of it.
",5
5158,"UPDATED: OCT 10, 2006 A good beerfrom belgium. many complex layers of flavor, a head that lasts for years, very open and warm on the palate, rich oak balanced against sweet apricot.  Delicious.
",5
5159,"Very enjoyable Abbey beer.  Moderately strong with a distinctly fine taste.
",5
5160,"just classicly good. this should be as bad as beer gets like this should be like budweiser or something. the world would be cooler that way.
",1
5161,"750ml bottle shared with HogTownHarry at Brasserie Frisco. Pours a murky bubbly reddish-brown with a large lasting creamy off-white head. Nice aroma of yeast, dark fruit, brown sugar and spices. Sweet fruity flavour with yeast, spices, malt and a mild bitter finish -- very tasty. Alcohol is very well hidden. Medium bodied. Pleasant and easy to drink, this is very good stuff.
",5
5162,"UPDATED: JUN 5, 2007 Re Rate:  Pours a copper color with a very lively white head and nice lacing.  Lots of fruity tones, spices, yeast, and hops.  Taste of fruits, spice, caramel, citrus, and champagne.  Lots of flavor here; underappreciated when I first tried this...
",5
5163,"Enjoyed this beer, but again, is not the perfect beer that others claim.  Good mouthfeel, with a hoppiness that complements the maltiness nicely.  Wont drink regularly due to cost, however.
",5
5164,"Bouteille-Une dubbel brune avec une forte odeur dalcool. Got dpices et de fruits.
",5
5165,"UPDATED: JUN 7, 2007 This brew pours deep, burnt brown color w/ a full, semi cremy froth.  Posseses a rather impressive retention in the head compartment and recedes to reveal a thick, lasting lace. Aromas of a malted bamboo earthiness. Full nectar w/ ample residual effers to include a few Champagne streamers. Bold and very flavorful. Big and malty w/ only a mild sweetness. Strong flavors of  drunken brownies, dark fruits, a hint of mint, tobacco, and green dark wood.  Theres a persistant peachpit bittering that emerges early on. The finish is long and bittered well. Superb balance in such a strong and complex brew. Highly recommended.
",5
5166,"As it states a copper beer with a nice creamy head but quite small. Some caramel and toffee flavours detected in what is a great tasting beer.
",5
5167,"The filterless nature of this brew is probably one of the most interesting things about it. Smooth, clean, easy to drink with just a hint of bitterness.  This is a good dinner beer to augment a nice steak, although, a very rich meal would probably bland out the taste of the beer.
",5
5168,"I have never enjoyed ales of any flavor until now. All I remember of it was how smooth it was and how tall the head was. Gota try that Blue now.
",5
5169,"A very complete beer.  The beer is very cloudy, and the head is huge, and takes a while to go down.  The flavor is very good, with a rich array of fruits.  The beer was very clean, and left no bad aftertaste.  I highly recommend this beer.
",5
5170,"Bottle. Brown colour with a slim head. Fruity aroma. Fruity, nutty taste. I found this a bit lacking in body; moderate carbonation. Nowhere near as good as the Blue.
",5
5171,"Bottle.  Pours a medium amber with a thin white head. The aroma is a bit of citrus, some malt.  The flavor was a smooth.  Some honey, caramel with plenty of carbonation.  Well done!
",1
5172,"Strong fruit/citrus flavor and aroma. good aftertaste. A Very delightful ale.
",5
5173,"Looks very similar to the Blue.  Smells slightly more malty with some fruit.  Head dissapeared and was smaller to begin with.  A little nutty, or hazel-nutty in the taste, some caramel, honey, sweet tastes.  Very good.  Silky is a good description of mouthfeel.  Chimays are good, but sometimes the taste becomes a little TOO familiar by the end of the glass.  Very good in smaller increments though.
",5
5174,"(bottle) Hazy and murky mahogany colour with yeast floaties and a mid-sized foamy tanned head, slowly lacing. Sweet dark malts aroma with caramel, chocolate and faint hoppy and spicy notes. Sweetbitter flavour, medium to full bodied, lively carbonated mouthfeel. Light sweet initial toasted malty taste with caramel; dry and slightly bitter yeasty finish with a warming and well-integrated alcoholic note and a toffee-ish aftertaste. Quaffable brew, but there are better ones out there.
",1
5175,"I was expecting a lot from this beer but was dissapointed.Althought it wasnt a poor drink it just wasnt as interesting as I thought it would be.Light brown appearance and a pleasant texture without the obvious alchohol impact you would expect from a beer of this strength. There was  no complexity and nothing to say that this was a highly thought of Abbey beer.Still theres always the blue and the white left to try.
",1
5176,"bottle: Another great beer from Chimay, aroma, appearance and tests are all top a beer to be enjoyed.
",5
5177,"wonderful beer that is, for the most part, easily accessible. has a nice texture and a good balance of flavor, leaving you with a very satisfying taste in your mouth. enjoy this one and compare for yourself!
",5
5178,"UPDATED: JUL 10, 2006 Pours a red to light brown and hazy beer with sediments and a big creamy head with good retention that leaves a huge lacing. Nice yeasty aroma with caramel and spicey herbal hints. Very strong banana with palm syrup smell. There are also soft notes of raisins, fruits and vanilla. Flavor is moderately bitter with some coffee and nuts, ending slightly alcoholic and with a good finishing duration. Medium body. It feels incredibly smooth in the mouth with its silky texture and soft carbonation. This beer has a warming effect. Great.
",5
5179,"33 cl bottle. Pours with good sized, quickly dissapating off white head leaving some lacing and coppery amber color. Pleasant spicy floral aroma. Slightly dry smooth spicy flavor with a hint of alcohol and a touch of bitterness. Yeasty spice flavor lingers. I will have more of this brew.
",5
5180,"dark brown with nice thick head. very malty with hidden fruit smells and flavors that dont release until it warms. smooth body with bitter aftertastes. a delicate beer...try one
",5
5181,"Pours amber red, very cloudy. Yeasty spicy aroma. Strong carbonation, faint hops, restrained malt sweetness, strong yeast presence, citrus zest residual spiciness. Delicious!
",5
5182,"Bottle, 33cl.  Pours an amber brown with a large lacy head.  Slight hint of bananas and spices.  Has a fruity slight yeasty flavor.  This is my favorite of the Chimay, and it tastes even better in the Chimay glass.  Great.....
",5
5183,"Pours a murky, copper/mahogany with a large initial head that dwindled quickly to a cream-colored ring. Aroma finds musty yeasts with light hopping, mild barnyard and new shoe-leather. Fluffy mouthfeel. Flavor is smoked, sweet & sour fruitiness (cherry dominates) with vinous notes, finishing with a spicy dirtiness. Not bad... not sure why all the fanfare...			<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp? Liquors, Oak Forest, IL 60452<font size=-1>
",1
5184,"11 oz. bottle.  Very smooth, didnt expect that at all.  Strong, enjoyable.  Fruit flavor, and deffinately a ale to enjoy for a long time.
",5
5185,"One of the smoothest beers I have ever had.  Sweet aroma, a slightly thin head, fruity, hoppy taste
",5
5186,"Enjoyable. I had ""Chimay Premiere"" in one of the large bottles, splitting half ot it with a friend. It was enjoyable, strong, very drinkable, though inferior to Chimay Blue in my opinion.
",5
5187,"Dark coppery colored with light brown head. Very light fruit aroma. Not a really strong fruit flavor or taste in general as other trappists.
",5
5188,"Bottle. Off-white short head. Unclear orange red body. Aroma of berries. First impression of flavor is sweet berriest is however modified by the powerful carbonation.
",1
5189,"UPDATED: FEB 28, 2006 A sweet almost barleywine like aroma.  Cloudy red appearance with no carbination.  A tart and floral flavor with a medium body.
",1
5190,"UPDATED: MAR 26, 2006 I think this was my first Abbey Dubbel which ment why it was weaker than a triple or quadrupel. Pours a dark mahogany with very fluffy white head. Aroma is fruity and the taste is the same as it. Fruity but you could tell it was weak, the alcohol didnt have the kick and make it that much fruitier, ok but Ill take a stronger abbey anyday.
",1
5191,"Cloudy, dark ruddy copper colored pour with a tall nutty head.  Yeasty nose with some dried prune.  Very yeasty flavor as well and the texture is quite buttery.  This beer starts with a nice herbal hoppiness, and finishes with a touch of cinnamon and clove.  Very nice overall.
",5
5192,"Foamy cream-colored head on a hazy reddish brown body.  Aroma was initially more hoppy than I expected, then with some time displayed sweet red fruits that became more and more apparent.  Fairly carbonated on the tounge and medium-bodied.  Smooth and a little yeasty.  Flavor is subdued, but good.  A very pleasant beer, but not very complex.
",5
5193,"Mon premier Chimay que j,ai bu, mailleur que la blanche, car je la trouve moin amre et plus riche; un peu sucr et caramelis.
",5
5194,"excellent reddish brown hazy color and a very nice inch head Mostly diminishing. A very enjoyable earthy / fruity taste. a must try for any new beer tasters
",5
5195,"Pours a hazy brown with an average off white lightly lacing head.  Aroma of dark fruits, candy sugar and a bit floral. Flavor was yeasty, lightly fruity, nutty and a little metallic. A little thin.
",1
5196,"Lovely color once poured. Very nice 1 inch head, lacey when finished. Tasted yeasty and was very smooth. I enjoyed this beer although was my first, will drink again for sure.
",5
5197,"Dirty red-brown beer with a nice off white head. Aroma is malty and light fruity. It has a good nutty caracter and a maltyness. Taste is very refreshing for this style. It has a nice earthy touch, a fine fruityness and a great nutty feeling. In the finish there is a subtile bitterness..
",5
5198,"UPDATED: SEP 22, 2006 [bottle] Very cloudy, reddish color with a huge, cottonish head. Flavors are very complex.. funky yeast, sweet frutiness, and very subtle alcohol content. Strong carbonation. This is a very fine beer.
",5
5199,"Murky orange-brown with tan head.  The head stayed till the end.  Sour yeasty aroma with some sweet notes.  Palate was a surprise with maltiness, caramel, lots of carbonation and yeast.  To me its an honest well-made beer.
",5
5200,"[Bottle, 75cl, fresh, chilled]	Everything has been said on this. Lets just say that its another great trappist. Fruity nose.. plum/berry. Malt hits first then a bitter hint get noticed. Fine beer overall. To my opinion, the palate is the only deceiving part of the beer..  I guess i had high expectation for that beer but i find the body a little light,  the texture thin and the finish abrupt..
",5
5201,"UPDATED: SEP 3, 2006 Complex taste.  Fruity tasting , mostly apricot and maybe a hint of plum, some spices that are unknown to me.  Yeast setiment at bottom of bottle.  Beautiful hazy, dark copper color.  My first Chimay and boy have Ive been missing out.  One bottle will warm you up nicely on a cold winter night. Cant wait to try the Blue next week.
",5
5202,"Again with the yeast. Chimay Red was a good looker but poor performer. Its overcarbonated and equally flat if that makes sense. Blue has grown on me into some sort of chewy metamorphosis, but red I dont think has a chance. At best I got a faint amount of malt and some caramelly tones. maybe some dark fruits but I was so frustrated that I didnt bother. bleh
",1
5203,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2006 Nice, creamy head with an absolutely wonderful aroma, slightly fruity. Malt hits you first. Followed by a little hopiness at the end that gives it just the right amount of bite and bitterness. Wonderful, I like this beer a lot. High dollar, but I will drink again! The only thing I didnt like about the beer was the cloudy, brownish color. Otherwise, it was great!
",5
5204,"An Excellent refreshing brew.  A rich reamy head....deep copper colour.  A wonderful Belgian.
",5
5205,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2009 Bottle: Pours a hazy copper with thick creamy head. Aroma is fruity apricot and caramel sweet maltiness.	Flavour is a mix of cherry and apricot with  a slight bitter aftertaste. Some sour molasses tones as well.
",5
5206,"A very tasty dubbel.  Maybe the best I have ever tasted.  Better than Westmalle, and better than Konings Hoeven, but not by much, as those are all great beers!  Great with Chinese, or mexican food.  A little too expensive at about $10 for a 750 ML bottle, but I none the less consume one every three or four weeks !!
",5
5207,"Bottle. Pours a cloudy dark reddish amber with a large, white thick head. Aroma is a lot of Belgian yeast with tones of banana and cloves and spiciness, some candy sugar. Taste is strongly clovey, with some pepper and Belgian yeast. Palate is alright, not as strong as it should be.
",5
5208,"snifter at cool river;    dark coppery color with a thin off white head. Aroma is dark fruit?  this to me is a subdued dubbel and I like that better than some that are tooo much of everything - sweet slight carbonation; good not worth the $ in my opinion
",5
5209,"Bottle 33 cl. A mahogany colour with a white (small bubbly) head. The aroma of sweet, fruity and some yeast. The carbonation is good. It has a medium sweet taste, some yeast and maybe caramel. A beer that met my expectations but not the best Chimay
",5
5210,"[330ml bottle, Peckhams Stockbridge, Edinburgh] Gusher on opening  seems to happen a fair bit with Chimay beers. Huge head from the gush, deep rusty brown pour. Slight caramel notes on the aroma, plenty of sweet fruity malt in evidence. Slightly bitter taste, some woodiness, mostly caramel malt. Slightly sour aftertaste. Really good drinker, particularly for 7% [04102007]
",5
5211,"Pours a dark amber colour with a tall frothy off white head. Aroma is fruity malt and some yeast. Taste is also fruity with hints of caramel and yeast. Little bitterness in the finish. Probably the weaker of the Chimays but still a beautiful beer.
",5
5212,"pours red with a luxurious off white head and minimal lacing.  Aroma is boozy with yeast, bread and cranberry notes.  The mouthfeel is crisp and biting (lots of carbonation) but the body is full.  taste is yeast and cranberry with a hint of caramel.  finish is simple and bitter.
",5
5213,"Fine head, dark golden	Light nose, caramel, herbs and a little citrus	very lively w medium body and a fine length	Taste w. Orange, light caramel	A bit dissapointing
",1
5214,"On tap.  Initial fruity taste with a sour/bitter bite.  Mellowed a little after the first drink.  Pretty good overall.
",5
5215,"""Poured out a copper color with a huge head with a ton of staying power. Has a fruity smell. Has an unbelievable smooth flavor. This is one i will try again and will now have to try other chimay""
",5
5216,"This was the first Belgian Ale I ever had not to mention Tappist. Thus commenced my happy journey down the hoppy highway through the bourgs of beer from Belgium. I sometimes like to decant it, others drink it all. Only because of the health benefits, mind you. The color is an intriguing dark. The head wasnt huge that I recall. The flavor was the same way, especially with the yeast. Gave it a bit of a nutty quality to contrast with the vineous malty character. Superb beer. An all-time fav. Too bad theyre jacking up the price so high that Bodega cant carry it anymore. Wahhh....
",5
5217,"Pours a cloudy, unfiltered brown with an off-white head which almost fades completely but sustains itself if you swirl it around. Flavor has notes of raisin, white wine, apple, cherry, clove, banana and some caramel/toastiness. Well balanced. Medium to full bodied on the palate with that airy, soft yet very lively Chimay carbonation. Not my favorite style but a well made beer overall.
",5
5218,"Bottle, at home (030925).	Bronze with light brown head, longlasting, unfiltered. Aroma and flavor: sweet, light yeasty, light alcoholic, no particular finish. Medium body, the alcohol is felt.
",1
5219,"Bottle.  Pours a nice deep mahogany color with a moderate creamy off white head.  Lacing is minimal.  Light bread dough aroma with some fruitiness.  Big malt, bread type flavor, some fruit in the taste as well and a little corn.  Medium body and slightly creamy on the palate.  Finish is slightly bitter.  A very easy drinking beer.
",5
5220,"This beer poured a nice head with a golden dark brown appearance.  A full bodied carmel taste.  A smooth finish to a well balanced beer.
",5
5221,"A good Belgian. Doesnt taste strong at all. Only real defect is overcarbonation.

5222,"Poured from the bottle this beer appears a dark copper with a nice creamy head. Aroma is fruity with that distinct belgian yeast tone. Flavor is spicy on the tongue with plenty of banana bread maltiness rounded out by a slight bitter in the finish. Fizzy on the palate with medium body and a smooth coating of fruit tones left behind. Well balanced and well crafted...god bless the monks.
",5
5223,"Pours a nice cola colored brown.  Aromas of dark malts, fruit, and a touch of spice.  Has flavors of chocolate, caramel, and a touch of wood.
",5
5224,"Small bottle. What a surprise. Even with my limited experience..I found this beer to be near perfection in a glass This beer was served in a local pub  in the proper Chimay goblet  glass and at the proper  temperature. You dont see that too often. (Other members in my group complained  that their beer was not cold enough !! ) A perfect balance of spices, malts and creaminess. Simply an very enjoyable  drinking experience. You just sip this beer  very slowly as oppose to gulping it. Makes a good  accompaniment with your dinner.
",5
5225,"Nice red color with cream colored head.  Musty and fruity aroma.  Bitter and fruity flavor with hint of alcohol.  Smooth and creamy finish.
",5
5226,"Large bottle.  Dark reddish-brown.  No shortage of yeast, but it is not offensive.  Fruity aroma and taste that somewhat belies the alcohol content.  My favorite of the Chimays.  This is the one that showed me many years ago that the U.S. really didnt know how (at that time) to brew a great beer.
",5
5227,"Small bottle.  Pours a deep amber color, clear, except for the few yeasties that made it in the glass.  Nice sized off-white head that lingers indefinitely and leaves suprisingly little lacing.  Aroma is fruity and sweet with hints of cola.  Plenty of yeast in the nose.  Lighter bodied with a high level of carbonation that never seems to fade.  Ample bitterness balances the sweet sugar and fruit flavors nicely.  Decently done.
",5
5228,"At first whiff, dry and woody, but subsequent pulls reveal more sweetness and hints of considerable alcohol. Very dark reddish brown body with plenty of large, floating sediment. Color is very similar to the ""red"" color of the label, so close in fact that it must have been made that way purposefully. Average-sized to large, off-white head that is slow to dissipate. Not much lace. Initial mouthfeel tastes identically to the aroma. After a couple of sips I detected a delecatable buttery component. Wonderfully pleasant and balanced; my initial impression that this brew was pedestrian proved wrong; it is really nice. Not as carbonated a mouthfeel as a lot of Belgians. Nectar. This would be a great beer to replace the customary bottle of wine as a gift when attending a party.
",5
5229,"High level of carbonation with a golden brown color.  Really needed to be enjoyed in a Trappist glass with a wide mouth.  A good amount of malts are present with a very delicate aftertast.
",5
5230,"Thick creamy white head that lasts a good while. Dark reddish brown in color. Aroma of spice. Soft flavor of spice with malty tones.
",5
5231,"Poured with very creamy and somewhat rocky off-white head.  Head had good rentention and showed nice lacing.  Nose is of plum, and clove, reminds me of weizein bock a little.  Favor is malty caramel and has a nice warming effect.  Very good carbonation.
",5
5232,"I havent had an abbey dubbel in quite some time so this was a nice treat.  Pours a solid and dense tea color brown thats very cloudy and hazy.  Head is a lavishing thick cream covering that remains until the finish.  Aroma is lightly spiced and fruity with reminders of clove, pear and plum.  Palate is silky and velvet like with perfect levels of carbonation that smooths out. Flavor shows its true colors through a rich vanilla cream profile and hides a distant yeast and spice in the background.  Some sign of the fruit detected but very faint and almost goes unnoticed.  I for sure will be buying another bottle of this again.  The best abbey dubbel i know of and thats why i rate it overall as a perfect beer.
",5
5233,"11.2 oz brown bottle purchased from Armanettis, Mundelein, IL.  Clear hazy amber hued ale having small off-white diminishing head with excellent lacing. Some floating yeast chunks.  Fruity aroma with hints of caramel and raisins (prune?).  Soft carbonation.  Medium-to-full palate that starts with sharpness, fruitiness, and slight sweet malt with hints of caramel, prune (raisin).  Finishes dry with light bitterness.  A good drinkable Belgium ale.
",1
5234,"Corked bottle: Quickly diminishing head, but small bubbles continue through. Mild aroma with some slight yeast notes. Hazy reddish brown. Some sugary hints as well as some plum. A quick bite from the carbonation, but finishes nicely.  A little tamer than the blue
",5
5235,"Hazy amber-red copper, with orangeish highlights, and a foamy tan-colored head. Nice fruity and spiciness, caramelized malt, brown sugar aromas follow through on a medium-bodied palate with a good carbonation and a multitude of small bubbles tickling the tongue, with fruity note of dates, brown sugar, toffeish hint, caramelized malt, spicy nutmeg, leading towards a sweet malty and a shy flowery hops finish.
",5
5236,"Dark brown in color with an off white head.   Faint aroma with a faint taste. Malty flavor with light light hops.
",5
5237,"Amber body with big off-white head. Aroma is yeasty and fruity. The flavor is slightly dry and of dark fruits. Sparkling mouthfeel with a dry, bitter finish.
",5
5238,"bottle. Pours a cloudy dark orange with a nice foamy white head. The aroma is full and floral with plenty of dry fruits. Nice rich dry spiced notes with a thinner underlying sweetness. The finish lingers with a hint of alcohol, some fading sugar, and really brings everything together.
",5
5239,"Great copper pour with a serious cream head. Nose is apricot. Mouth is creamy apricot and fig...bit of malt. Good beer. I not a huge fan of Trappist beer, but I do like this better than some others I had.
",5
5240,"Lightly floral aroma, with wheat, maybe a tad of lemon. Pours an opaque caramel brown/tan, with a generous creamy white head. Head dissipated in about a minute. Flavor is heavy with malt and fruit, apples and pears. Finishes with malt, apples, and a hit of floral hops. Feels thick, not as creamy as Chimay Bleue, with active carbonation. Warming in the chest as opposed to the face. Very tasty.
",5
5241,"Au Naturale. 		Loving it, but I think it was better when it was not mass  produced years back. I question quality recently.		Chimay, beautiful. 		I give Microbrews current edge even over Chimay. Just prefer  taste of  the home made flavor of Microbrews even over some European excellence.
",1
5242,"Very good.  Doesnt disappoint from start to finish.  Full bodied in palate and flavor.  Light bitterness in the finish.  Well balanced overall, good looking, nice aroma.  Thumbs up!
",5
5243,"very good beer, drinks smooth and full -- a very nice mellow abbey beer.  Bot as good as other chimay offerings but good.  I drinking this as I log in my Brewtopia tastes!  Life is good
",5
5244,"#300. Never rated it though I drink it on a regular base. Nice reddish brown with a steady off-white head. Malts and red fruit in the nose. Fruity, fresh taste, good bitterness in the end. Not too sweet, wellbalanced. Full, creamy mouthfeel, maybe just a little thin towards the end (but not AT the end)this is one of the best dubbels..
",5
5245,"Unlike the commercial description, i found the red to have a light, quickly dissipating head.  The aroma was rich and inviting.  The taste was slightly bitter, but very smooth and full.  I was able to taste the fruit, and was left with an overall pleasing, and clean taste.
",5
5246,"Cloudy brown with a tan head that seems to last forever. Oddly, lacing is nil. Sweet, fruity nose some figs, apricot, slightly malty. Silky mouthfeel, a touch creamy, good light carbonation. Flavor is considerably lighter than other Chimay brews I have tried, not as complex. Fruity but not quite as sweet as the nose implies, apricot and malt, a touch of pepper. Fairly clean finish, but it leaves me wanting. A good dubbel, but feels incomplete.
",5
5247,"UPDATED: NOV 9, 2005 Nice aroma, very cloudy/red with typical clear/white head.  A little metallic aftertaste but nice entry.
",1
5248,"Bottle. Poured an amber with good fizzy head. There was a nose of pepper and spice. The taste was great, pepper in the nose, vanilla in the after taste. Pretty good.
",5
5249,"UPDATED: MAR 12, 2006 Poured from the botte at The Jolly Gardeners (Putney, London), a reddish brown with a creamy head. A fruity aroma with hints of strawberries and banana. A sweetish flavour with fruit coming through again (tangy pear). Initially smooth in the mouth with a nice natural carbonation and a tangy sour aftertaste.
",5
5250,"Pours an opaque deep brown.  Aroma of malt, raisins and brown sugar but not strong.  Great bubbly mouthfeel, well done, with a minerally flavour.  Irony.  Enjoyable, but not overwhelming.
",1
5251,"Not a huge fan of this beer. Trappists to me, almost always seem to have the nose and finish which suggests cloves to me, which is a good way to turn me off to a beer.
",1
5252,"OK. Under tough circumstances this could be the best of whats available. But generally not a top choice for Belgians.
",5
5253,"Bottle.  Pours a hazy warm umber with a thin creamy head that lasted through the entire glass. Very pleasant light fruity aroma.  Flavors of caramel, malt, and a bit peppery. Very smooth. Almost creamy mouthfeel. Good stuff!
",5
5254,"33cL bottle.  Deep copper pour with a short off-white head and lots of dark sediment suspended in there.  Dark fruits prevalent in the aroma (plums and apricots primarily), along with some Belgian yeast and peppery spices.  Flavor was definitely more impressive and intense... with the fruits deeper and more rich, the yeast imparting somewhat musty notes, and the spices were just well-balanced in there.  Very smooth on the palate, with the wonderful flavors cascading across the palate.  Sweet fruityness at the finish with some nice spices.  Beautiful beer.
",5
5255,"Im not really sure what to say about this beer. It was pretty smooth and malty with a decent spicy/peppery taste. Im not sure that this is one Id buy again, but I did enjoy it.
",5
5256,"An excellent softly spicy, malty dubbel with a hint of citric bitterness. A good Belgian anyone can enjoy.
",5
5257,"Spicy lighter chimay.  Peppery fruits and a red zing slipping in my throat.  all happy and good in bed.  but give me the blue... the blue... what a beautiful bootle to make you happy every time you see it...but..a favorite beer but ... i know its all about the blue...
",5
5258,"Striking reddish brown pour supporting a wonderful pillowy and massive head with long retention and lines of velcro lacing.  Slightly sour aroma of yeast, malt, cobwebs and sweet berries.  Well balanced but strongly malty flavor surrounded by whirls of fruit, spice and vanilla all backed up with a modest hoppy bite.  Creamy mouthfeel with some nice effervescence and a snappy but sweet finish.  This is a world classic for a reason but it is still surprisingly accessable to many palates.
",5
5259,"Smells spicy.  Looks cloudy. Tastes bitter but good.  Pours tan head.  Mmmm.
",5
5260,"Incredible colour.  Incredible head.  Creamy.  Very fruity Abbey.  Perhaps slightly too bitter for me for this type of beer, but good.  Not my favorite from Chimay.
",5
5261,"Smooth and very nice mouthful. Dave bought for beach trip. Poured with thick white- tan head. Complex tasting.
",5
5262,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2006 This beer is one of my personal Favorites.  I knew it was going to be great as soon as I poured it into the glass.  The head was wonderful and light. I usually am a fan of a little bit more of a smoother beer like a lot of wheat beers are but this beer made me re-evaluate my opinion of what a beer should be.  The taste was very full and had a little bit of bite, but the aftertaste was sensational.  I have yet to try the Chimay Grand Reserve, this beer puts the Chimay white label to shame.  Much smoother and far better tasting.
",5
5263,"Bottle. Pours a dark, somewhat hazy, burnt red color with small white ehad. The aroma is oranges, wildflowers, and a bit of spice. The flavor is semi-sweet malt, bitter hops, yeast, and a touch of cloves.  It comes together pretty well, but doesnt linger at all.
",5
5264,"33cl bottle. Pours a deep cooper-brown, with a nice little tan head. Weak aroma of sweet, dry,fruit. mildy fruity, malty falvor with a dry slightly bitter finsih. Well balenced and very drinkable, but not as as complex as the other chimays.
",5
5265,"Tap, copper/yellow, somewhat hazy. Fruity aroma that fills your senses with some apricot, candied malts, and other complex fruity, dry hints. The fun begins when you taste bitter yet creamy mix and a slightly dry intervention. Silky but bitter. Awesome
",5
5266,"This is the second cimay Ive tried. (Tried the white first.) A little disappointed with the somewhat lack of aroma. What little there is though is quite fruity. A very attractive dusty copper colour. Tastes spicy and apricot/apple with a nice malt overtone. Thin in the mouth and fizzy (only way I can describe it). Finishes well with a bitter, creamy aftertaste. Good beer.
",5
5267,"750mL: Pours Dark brown/reddish, complex flavor, very spicy, somewhat fizzy, not much aroma.  Medium body, not bitter.
",5
5268,"Bottle (750ml).  Poured hazy deep reddish-brown with an average (for the type) lasting tan pancake-batter head.  Clove, coriander, other spices merge with yeast, light roast malt and sweet fruits for an appealing aroma.  Taste is quite tart apple, spices, some alcohol and hop (?) bitterness, very mild roast malt and yeast - finishes quite bitter.  Mouthfeel very lively, a little thin;  gets very moreish as it warms, it mellows out and the harshness abates.  Solid ""4"" in my book.
",5
5269,"Third out of three Chimays available in the Tolkiens House pub in Zagreb. 0.33l bottle / tiny Chimay tulip.  It poured a small firm ""spongy"" white head, and it was of a nice deep red colour (I think, it was dark outside). The nose was fruity, strawberry maybe, and coriander with some yeasty hints. Slightly sourish anyway. Pleasant taste, malty, fruity, spicy, herbal in a way, but far too prickly for my liking. Pleasant bitterish aftertaste though. Well, its the best dubbel Ive had, better actually (Ive had only two), and Im starting to like the style. This however, while nice, didnt make me love it.
",5
5270,"Pours a murky brownish red color with a medium sized cream colored head.  Aroma is fruit laced with hints of apricots,bananas, cream and malts.  Taste is a rather bland combination of the fruits described above with a creamy aftertaste.  The weakest of the 3 Chimay Trappistes.  Not bad but not as good as one would expect.
",5
5271,"This one was my favourite Chimay, but no.	Smells fruity, malty, slightly yeasty, berries.	Its fluffy and sort of uncomplex.	MOderate sweetness. Lightly bitter.
",5
5272,"Bottle (bomber): Quite a beer.  It pours a beautiful color.  Has a great big head tht you have to wait for it to dissapate so you can pour some more and wait again to finally drink.  Aroma is of nice fruity (apricot) aroma with hints of cream and banannas.  The taste isnt as full as I expected.  Very creamy and smooth, but the tastes werent as complex as I had hoped.
",5
5273,"One of the most attractive beers I have ever had the pleasure to pour, but it looks a lot better than it tastes, I will admit.  Although it has the lowest alcohol percentage out of the Chimay family, it has a surprisingly overwhelming taste of alcohol.  Its worth trying out (even if its just for aesthetics).
",5
5274,"Its a nice beer, a little too much head as seems to be custom with these Belgain 750ml bottles(Maybe it is just me). but I far perfer the White.   Cant wait to try the Blue.
",5
5275,"All of the Vhimary products are very good. Apricot is present in both the smell and the taste. Very creamy, and smooth. Full of flavor like its siblings.
",5
5276,"Malty fruity nose with hints of dried apricot.  Pours a transluscent copper with an off white head.  The taste is subtle and sweet and has a bitterness to it that gives a little bubbly sensation in your mouth.  It is very soft and smooth and was quite nice.
",5
5277,"33cl bottle. Browny red beer with thin beige/grey head. Seem to remember this being a dark malt beer, but not so. Yeast and red berry  nose. Yeasty in mouth, not a temendous depth then more strawbery/raspberry/kiwi fruit fruit and zingy hop dry finish. Drinkable and nice red berry juice, but not a lot of depth
",5
5278,"Oh! this is a good beer! I had it in the 750 ml bottle. Its a strong beer, but it doesnt feel too much like it. It drinks well.
",5
5279,"UPDATED: AUG 10, 2007 Re-Rate (2003 bottlling tasted 8/07): Certainly not inferior to younger samples I have tasted over the years. Really attractive to look at with a perfectly formed creamy head and murky brown body, not unlike the Rochefort 6 consumed just hours prior. Nose shows aromas of settled malts and hints of sweet milk chocolate, as well as a definate pongy edge that might be more commonly found in a Flemish sour ale. Palate is also settled, very balanced and very friendly. Nice milky chocolate notes pop up again, together with a midly spicy but quite long finish. Easily the best Rouge Ive had from Chimay.		(9/05): Big fizzy headupon pouring but disappears almost immediately. Light brown with a red hue. Some cloudiness, quite appealing. Classic Belgium nose of cloves, heavy malts, some spice, although quite subtle. Palate IMHO disappoints and is not worthy of the Chimay monicker. Very subdued flavours, almost to the point of being dilutive, the only telling character being some enthusiastic carbonation.  Bad bottle? (2.5)
",5
5280,"Bottle: Amber coloured with rouge sparks, cloudy, thin, but firm head; some fruitiness(bananas, vanilla) in the aroma, also yeast; slight fruity taste (bananas again) with shy tart bitter finish; quite light bodied (7% ABV !), a bit warming; well done, but all in all a bit disappointing: rather ""thin"" or lets say ""not very complex"" !
",1
5281,"UPDATED: DEC 24, 2005 (rerate - 12-24-05) Very nice classic dubbel appearance.  Yeasty, spicey aroma.  Bubblegum. Flavor mirrors the aroma with yeast, bubblegum, spice.  Fruit sneaks in at the end.  Plenty of carbonation. (7,4,8,3,16)		(original rating I gave it a 7,4,8,4,17)
",5
5282,"UPDATED: SEP 29, 2005 Bottle. Pours a cloudy light brown with small  frothy tan head. Very fizzy. Aroma is brown bread, fruit and a bit of yeast. Flavor is tart, spicy with a slightly dry finish, with some honey sweetness in there & a tiny bit metallic as well.  Gives a pleasant alcoholic tingle after finishing.
",5
5283,"Bottle from Morrisons (!) Attractive red brown colour. The head retreated into a thin covering quite quickly. Aroma of plummy fruit, bicuity malt, hint of cardboard. Rounded mouthfeel, spicy peppery finish. Not the beer it once was, but tasty nonetheless.
",5
5284,"The color is incredible and the light passing through it is very light at the top, very dark at the bottom.  I dont get the fruity taste that the commercial description mentions; I get a caramel smell...actually, fruit is the last thing I smell here so I dont know where that comes from.  it has a medium bitter taste and I love the big bottle...tasty
",1
5285,"Bottled.  This is a very smooth dubbel that is warming, yet is not very heavy or hard to drink.  The slight hop makes the finish very complex and satisfying.  I enjoyed this immensely.
",5
5286,"UPDATED: SEP 5, 2005 Quite possibly the best beer in the world. I absolutely love the Blue on a special occasion, but this ale has no peers in terms of balance and drinkability, being simultaneously estery, malty, slightly hoppy, with a perceived alcohol, yet eerily drinkable. A truly sublime drinking experience in a Chimay goblet with good company. It gets no better.
",5
5287,"I dont know if I got a bad bottle or what, but I only drank about a third of this and had to pour it out. Was a small bottle.	To bitter for my tastes, not what I was expecting. I usually agree with the ratings on here but...I just dont like this one..	Blue = good	Red = icky
",1
5288,"UPDATED: DEC 18, 2005 The strongest of the Chimay in my opinion. A lasting bitter taste with red fruits flavor. Worth it.
",5
5289,"Very nice dark red color with a thick and lasting slighlty off-white head.  Spicey and slightly fruity aroma. Wonderful spicey clove flavor with a strong bitter finish and warming alcohol flavor. Tastes surprisingly strong for only 7% ABV. A real treat.
",5
5290,"Got this in the small bottle.  Its one of the first ""high alcohol"" beers to trickle into my supermarket since NC has passed its ""pop the cap"" legislation.  I tried Chimay blanche once when I smuggled a bottle from Tennesse.  But Chimay Rouge is superior in flavor.  There is less of the characteristic Belgian spiciness.  And excellent hop/malt balance with a little bit of alcohol at the end.  Very nice.  Should be tasting a lot more higher alcohol beers now that NCs cap has been popped.  *grin*
",5
5291,"This was the first beer I bought when I got to NC last week in honor of the repeal of the 6% law.  Pours cloudy medium brown with large white head.  Vary carbonated.  Has a very yeasty and malty aroma.  Taste is kinda toasty/cardboard/yeasty.  Not too overwhelming.  Pretty good.  I think I like it better than the Blue.
",5
5292,"Murky brown in colour, the head doesnt last long despite the steady bead of bubbles. There is an astringent edge which really spoils the palate for me. I find this thin and watery, the high alcohol therefore becomes harsh and unbalancing.I have tried this several times pre-ratebeer and enjoyed it, but this bottle was a big let down. May rerate at a later date.
",1
5293,"Oen of the top beers Ive found. The apricot tinged little wonder is just tart enough, just sharp enough, and just pleasant enough for ""anytime"" drinking.
",5
5294,"Dark brown and slightly cloudy. Excellent off white head. The taste was to my mind quite similar to the Chimay Bleu: certainly it had the same generous alcoholic warmth and aftertaste. Wonderful beer.
",5
5295,"11.2oz bottle in a Trappist glass.  Pours opaque brown with a lingering, thick beige head.  Aroma of spicy yeast, brown sugar, caramel malts, and light hops.  Flavor mainly from the yeast and malts, but there is a hoppiness at the end.  Silky texture.  A pretty good beer.

",5
5298,"Bottle 0,33ltr: For i began to rate, i got three bottles with three different expiring dates . 		The first, expiring date 2005 hazy brown coloured, with an burning mouthfeel. Taste of an very mellow smooth faint whiskey and there is an good vanilla smell and taste also.		The second, expiring date 2008 this have not that whiskey-like appearance, but is more nuttier of taste, and hints of caramel. But its slight weaker of character.		The third. expiring date 2014, the one thats counts for this rating. This have more body and have an more foamy head. More taste of spices, and hints of caramel.
",5
5299,"33cl bottle from the Doerak, Delft.	Amber colour, decent head.  I much prefer the Chimay Blue.  Its more complex
",1
5300,"UPDATED: JUN 14, 2011 Aroma: Sour, a very slight soapyness, trace of alcohol, some yeastyness, a little bit bitter. Bland. 		Appearance: Bottle into a wine glass. A dark bronze sorta color with a huge off-white head that took a while to diminish...looks really cool. When I opened this one, it had sat for a day and it STILL exploded when I opened it. Talk about entering with a bang. Very little carbonation and some floaties. 		Taste: Arrgh. Watery, very slight sweetness at first, more water and then bitterness afterward. Not bad, but honestly kinda lame in the sense that I was expecting MORE COMPLEXITY, considering this is a trappist ale. Its not bad...just boring.	Palate: Watery, not much carbonation and leaves much to be desired. 		Overall: $3.90 and the Blue is right beside it and 10 cents more. F me sideways, I might as well buy the blue. I think the high and similar price to the blue had me expecting too much in a way. 		RE-RATE 2/6/2011: Aroma: Sour, candi sugar, trace of alcohol, some yeastyness, a little bit bitter. Has the character of the blue a bit.		Appearance: Bottle into a Chimay glass. A dark bronze sorta color with a huge off-white head that took a while to diminish...looks really cool. This one exploded too. Bang. Beer in the sink, with an angry human watching said beer go away. Tsk tsk, into the Chimay glass on the double.		Taste: Honey and flowers, some hoppyness afterward, kinda boozy. Theres a strong taste I cant ID, but all Chimays have it, so Im gonna call it the ""taste of Chimay"". Probably the malts and Chimay yeast.		Palate: Somewhat thin, strong carbonation, though smooth and pleasant. Champangney Ill call it, or maybe ""Chimayney"". How I wish there was italics here. And post formatting.		Overall: I had to re-rate this, and as I suspected, I got a bad bottle before, thanks BCLC! ....fuckers.   I thought I was in for another round of torture, but this bottle was actually decent. Decent enough for me to bring it to 3.6 from 2.7.
",5
5301,"Red label, red beer, big white foamy head. A really nice dubbel, but without the sweetness a lot of them have. Slightly watery, but a great brown bread finish. Got this at the local Albert Heyn supermarket. Too bad the aroma isnt great, otherwise it would be a lot higher

5302,"Love this beer! The balance of malty sweet and dark fruit is perfect. So smooth in the mouth, one of the greats.
",5
5303,"Aroma dolce e fruttato. Gusto morbido e ricco. Corpo non eccessivo. Ha dalla sua il costo abbordabilissimo e la facilit di reperimento.
",5
5304,"Poured a very hazy dark copper with a creamy off-white head. Aroma was apricot, some raisin or dates and bit acidic. Taste is bread, fruits, and acidic as well. Very fizzy mouthfeel.
",5
5305,"Aroma is a sweet caramel malt. Taste has a strong sweetness with hints of caramel chocolate. Overall pretty good, but not extraordinary.
",5
5306,"33 cl. bottle.  Cloudy red/brown coulor with a big off-white head, that slowly fades to a fat cap. Aroma is those complex Belgian yeasts, brown sugar, bread, light pepper, and light apricots and banana.  Sweet taste with notes of bread, malts, sweet fruits and a light bitterness in the finish. Medium to full body, Nice and creamy texture. Long lasting finish. An excellent dubbel - enjoyed this one.
",5
5307,"Bottle (330ml):	There is a strong smell of dried fruits from this beer, dark summery fruit and berries in particular along with a touch of alcohol and grain owing to the strong alcohol content. There is also a strong malt aroma and a faint touch of caramel on the nose along with some good spicy notes right at the end.		Dark, orangey brown colour when poured and forms a thick looking, three-finger sized head that is off-white and foamy. The head roughly halves in size over the course of about a minute then holds at around a finger width tall for the remainder of the drinks life.		Sweet tasting with a lot of dried fruit to begin with in the taste and perhaps a bit of apple too. There is a lot of brown sugar like flavouring and a little bit of the roasted malts from the nose as well along with touches of alcohol. Its is a pretty solid effort from this beer.		Huge carbonation in this beer, a lot more than I had been expecting but that is not to say it was overly carbonated because it seemed to work for this particular beer. It was pretty smooth, with a medium body and great drink-ability; overall an nice beer on the palate.		A very good beer overall and one that I really enjoyed, it has most things going for it and not a lot holding it back. It may not be as good as Chimay Bleue but it was still a very good beer indeed.		1001 Beers Blog: htp://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com

5308,"Bottle - very big thick head, dark amber color, sweet malty aroma, sweet malty flavor with that Belgian yeast kick, almost a little bit of a chocolate flavor in there as well - very good beer
",5
5309,"New Years. Poured into goblet. Dark ruby red, fizzy carbonation keeps thin layer of foam present on top.  Aroma is spicy yeast, caramel, dried dark fruit.  Sweet caramel start, with plum, then gingerbread spice in the middle, and hint of coffee bitterness in the finish.  Lighter body than expected. Deceptively sessionable.
",5
5310,"Pours a murky amber - brown. The aroma is fruit and yeast - raisin, peach, and apple. Quite light bodied, perfect creamy carbonation, very fruity, slightly bitter finish, very drinkable. No where near the complexity of the Blue or White, but a delicious and classic beer. A great trappist dubbel.

5311,"UPDATED: SEP 22, 2005 Good beer. A bit to smokey for my taste. A little too much like beef jerky. Enjoyable and interesting but not as good as the blue.

5312,"Great - but there is too much of an alcohol bite/aroma for a 7% ABV beer....		Also - its not your typical Belgian - its lighter and less complex than some of my favorite Belgian beers. However, for some this may be a good thing... especially if youre planning to drink a lot at one sitting...
",5
5313,"Dark red-brown colour with a fast disappearing white head. The aroma is a bit to strong but complex. The taste is sweet and fruity with a hoppy undertone. (Bottle 33cl)
",1
5314,"darker pour, sweet malty flavor.  pretty much the same rating as the white, its been said 750+ times on this beer, so i dont feel the need to reiterate all of that.  its a damn fine beer, and if you see one, buy it to try it.
",5
5315,"After having such an incredible beer its difficult to go back and enjoy the mere mortal brewery offerings, but very well understood why so many other brewers like Ommegang, Allagash and the assorted other dubbel makers would try and duplicate. The heady aroma, magnificant maroon color, and distinctive malt, clove and spice flavor are well documented here but needs to be experienced for the special subtleties that make this such a refined and distinctive beer. This is Belgium brewing at its best.
",5
5316,"Wonderful beer, Very solid, but probably my least favorite of the Chimay beers. Still has great taste and body. The last sip from the last glass is just as tasty as the first one.
",5
5317,"(on bottle)Hazy, ruby red with a patch white head. Surprice came over me with the hoppy aroma, big for a dubbel..Fresh and pearly mouthfeel and a taste dominated by caramel and old, sweet grapes.. Slightly bitter finish. lacks a bit warmth from the alcohol.
",5
5318,"brownish appearance kinda looked like ice tea.  almost a chocolatty smell to it bit of fruit.  smooth body you can get better beers for half the cost of this.
",5
5319,"Hazy brown beer with creamy light beige head. Good maltyness some caramel, some spices and dried fruits. Taste is smooth soft malt, has some dry fruit accents and a nice touch of spices.
",5
5320,"pours a reddish color with a decent fluffy heady aromas of fruit,  belgian style spices and sweetness, taste is of smoothness, carbonation, fruit, and spices a very nice abbey dubbel.
",5
5321,"330 ml bottle, served in a chimay glass. A dark cola brown color, with a dense medium head. It has a malty and alcoholic aroma. The beer itself is spicy and has a hot mouthfeel and a malty taste. The less good of the Chimay beers, but still a good beer.
",1
5322,"This beer has a brown body - hue apperance and a coarse light brown scum collar. I have drunk the beer from the bottle and it had a lot of carbonic acid. The initial flavor taste is sweet with a sweet afther tast.
",5
5323,"Pours a deep amber.  Creamy head with lacing.  Great combination of aromas.  Great complexity, great balance, and a great beer.
",5
5324,"Tried this in Denver.  A bit fuity for my liking and not enough carbonation.  I am partial to the Pale Ales so the hoppiness just wasnt there.
",1
5325,"Apple, banan, raisin, coriander taste, but not real strong.  Very refreshing and smooth with barely a hint of the alcohol.  Unassuming but clean and smooth with a good but subtle flavor.
",5
5326,"Cork popped off with a shot, and I almost lost it behind the television set.  Beautiful head that overflowed the bottle and filled the glass.  Then continued on for the enire pour.  Aromas were instantly spicy and fruity.  Flavors were much drier than I had expected with all the spice and and maltiness coming through.  Dry, bitter finish.  I thought I was going to like this better than the Blue since it was a Dubbel, but I will have to stick with the majority and put my order in at Blue, Red, then White.
",5
5327,"Copper orange-brown, cloudy with fine particles. Puffy head, long lace. Yeasty, mildly fruity nose. Yeasty palate with hints of apple and sweet spice, pleasantly bitter finish. Very nice, but I think I prefer the white.
",5
5328,"UPDATED: OCT 16, 2006 great beer,texture and a smooth and very unique taste.Love the trappist beers!
",5
5329,"Pours a beautiful opaque copper with a frothy off-white head. The aroma is light and fruity, apricot, banana and various spices are noticeable. The mouthfeel is smooth and soothing. It lightly tickles your tongue and the back of your throat as it goes down. The flavor is yeasty and bitter but well balanced. Not as complex as the Chimay Bleue but interesting nonetheless and easy to drink.
",5
5330,"UPDATED: JUL 7, 2006 Deep hazy auburn brown colour with a thick creamy and lasting head. Dusty, fruity aroma, with hints of spice. Flavour is sweet and bitter, but does not linger.  Re-rate: Lots of boiled veges (zucchini?). Aggressively sweet and bitter, but neither dominates. A classic, but there are better out there
",5
5331,"Biting odor, vaguely cinnamon/rhubarb. Deep reddish color, with auburn highlights. Medium white head. Biting, bitter flavor. Very carbonated.
",5
5332,"Very nice. Head is effervescent and smooth.  This is as nice, and perhaps smoother, thant he white.  Easy, simple, unassuming, powerful.  Not as flavorful as the white but still nice.
",5
5333,"Definitely a much lighter beer than the bleu.    The head is exceptionally thick, but dissipates quickly.  A good beer, but id probably stick with one of the other Chimay offerings.
",5
5334,"Reddish color and fruity taste.  Available at Downtown Wine & Spirits in Somerville, MA
",5
5335,"Fruity and mildly spicy aroma. Cloudy syrupy red color. Fluffy head. Head dissipates fast to a thin compressed line. Taste is spicy malt with a very nice mouthfeel. Some sweetness. Very doughy and bread pudding-like with a muted spiciness. The sipping Chimay! At a paltry 7% you can have about one more than you can of the others.
",5
5336,"Large, but quickly disappaiting tan head and reddish copper body flow from the 330 ml bottle.  Excellent lacing.  I miss the uncorking ceremony accompanying most good Belgians.  A light fruity aroma and subtle sweetness in the initial palate were a bit unexpected and differ a bit from other dubbels.  This variety is a tad less bold and complex.  Still, the advertised apricot flavor was present, as were plum and black cherry in the mid-palate.  A pleasant sourness and smooth dry finish put strong postmemo  to this beer.
",5
5337,"Could I join a monestary and spend the rest of my life brewing this beautiful nectar? OMG! Fantastic red color. Puffy, mousse-like head that clings to the glass. A little cloudy. Fruit, malts, excellent balance, smooth, nice finish.
",5
5338,"UPDATED: JUL 4, 2005 Nice red color. A great beer overall but my least favourite (less complex i would say) out of the three chimays that I have tried (blue,red, white).
",5
5339,"Pours a ruby red color with large head.  Tastes of fruit (apple), spices (clove and pepper), faint roast, and it has vinous notes to it as well.  Astringent and bitter its a pretty nice brew.
",5
5340,"dark red color with a foamy off white head.  dark fruit aroma.  similar to the other chimay ales but less complexity.  not as much spice on the tongue.  goes down warm.  still very good.
",5
5341,"Pours a absolutely beautiful reddish color.  The fluffy head on this beer is really icing on the cake of one of the best looking beers ive ever seen.  Cloudy to show that its unfiltered.  It smells of fruit and malts mostly.  Flavors are much like the smell would lead you to believe.  Its somewhat fruity and malty but has an excellent balance to it.  The mouthfeel is incredible very smooth and finishes great.  I cant wait to try the blue and other offerings from this monestary.
",5
5342,"Bottle, 33cl. Even though this is a wonderful beer, i must say Chimay Red is the one i least like from this brewery (ive also tried white and blue - a lot!). Beautiful reddish brown colour, a little cloudy, with a creamy beige head, that doesnt last long (at least for a trappist). The flavour is less complex than other Chimays and the taste includes impressions of malt, spices and oak. I prefer the flavour when the liquid is warmer. It seems more complex and tasteful. Conclusion: a very good Belgium Dubbel that reminds me how pleasurable is to drink an authentic trappist beer.
",5
5343,"Bottle. Served at the <a href=http://news.ratebeer.com/Place/illinois/blue- Tree Inn. A happy, hazy beer smell wafts from the Trappist glass after its poured. Brown and hazy body with a surface skim of light foam, but no lacing. The smell lightens up once you put your nose in the glass. Taste includes impressions of brown sugar, rum, and a slight prune darkness. Despite the relatively light alcohol for this style, theres actually a kind of barley win maltiness to it. Works well as a casual summer drunking experience. And Jeezis Peet, Ive just checked off the Maple Trees beer menu: they still have a dozen beers I havent rated yet! Hmmm...
",5
5344,"750 mL bottle.  Pours a cloudy reddish brown with no head except for a thin ring around my snifter.  Aroma is malty and nutty with dried fruit, spice and yeast with a bit of sourness in the foreground.  Flavor is of doughy malt and sweet fruit (dried cherries, peaches, and plums) and spice (corriander and allspice).  There is a pleasant Bretty sourness found in this beer that I think helps balance and round it out.  I getting a bit of hop bitternes but next to no flavor so I assuming they are using old hops as is usual with the lambic brewers.  Also some tannins are evident in the dry finish.  Body is medium-full with a good bit of carbonation.  Great beer, better than Bleu I think.
",5
5345,"UPDATED: OCT 9, 2009 Bottle, 7%. Yeasty, malty aroma, slightly spicy with some CO2. Hazy chestnut colour, semi-stable tan head. Quite yeasty flavour with a long malty aftertaste. Not as sweet as some dubbels, but not really dry either. Mouthfeel a little swelling, due to quite high carbonation.
",5
5346,"A light brown colour, with a good head. Spicy aroma, with a sweet taste. An okey beer, but the Chimay bleu is the best from this brewery.
",1
5347,"03 or 04 Bottle.  Nice brown/red color with big head.  Lots of the Belgian yeast in the aroma, nice and spiced, with some fruits.  More of the yeast and sweet malts and fruits in the flavor, and an appropriately thick mouthfeel.
",5
5348,"Nice fruity aroma and beutiful reddish brown color. A nice drinkable belgian. Dry, fruity, and a touch of hops. Quite enjoyable.
",5
5349,"on tap.  Poured a nice copper with a nice head.  Aroma was hoppy and somewhat floral.  The flavor was acrid and overcarbonated, but overall pretty enjoyable
",5
5350,"Copper coloured beer with a creamy beige head, long lasting and with good lacing. Aroma includes fruity and floral characters with some caramel malts. Quite obvious alcohol content. A lot of complex fruity flavours aswell as sweet darkish malts and hops. Has a dryish, bitter flowery finish. An authentic trappist beer.
",5
5351,"UPDATED: MAY 20, 2007 11.2 oz bottle.. I had this last night because i hadnt tried it in forever, and I was glad I did.  It was expensive as hell, but worth it.  On the pour, good head, dark brown-red color, lots of carbonation.  Smell was fruity, cola-like spice.  The first taste was amazing, far better than what I remember.  Tasted like a lively brown ale, with a belgian-sweet finish. Nice warm alcohol notes.  Top notch!
",5
5352,".75 liter bottle.  .  Nice red color with a creamy head, very inviting smells of fruit and oak.  Taste is sweet with hints of fruit and caramel, well carbonated almost too much.  Sweet stickiness afterwords brings a need for water.
",5
5353,"05/03 on the cork.		Pours a rich auburn with a frothy light tan head. Smell is fruity, caramel malt, lightly bitter, candy sugar/molasses.		Taste is again that rich fruity and caramel malt. Lightly spicy. A bit overcarbonated but that fades as it warms. Rich and smooth. A bit sticky mouth especially in the aftertaste.		Not overly complex but surprisingly good.
",5
5354,"UPDATED: DEC 31, 2008 Bottled. Hazy brown colour with huge bubbly beige head. Sweet alcoholic citric aroma with some malty notes. Barley, malt and lots of yeast in the flavour. Also some banana and caramellish hints. Pleasant palate, but a bit much carbonation.
",5
5355,"On tap, served in the proper Chimay goblet.  An excellent Belgian, up there with the Bleu.  The yeasty smell is more subdued than the Bleu, but there is more fruit.  Quite refreshing.
",5
5356,"a mesandsim rate:	This is one of our old favourites - something we havent had for quite a while. Trying it recently reminded us that its a great beer. Good hearty trappist nose and flavour. Smooth and full-bodied. Complex and slightly sweet.
",5
5357,"11.20 oz. bottle from The Andersons, Columbus, OH.  Lovely orange-red with tons of tiny sediment at the bottom of the bottle; monstrous, white, fizzy, frothy head thats easily recreated with some light swirling.  Aroma is Belgian yeast, alcohol, and apple/pear.  Flavor is more of the Belgian yeast with an excellently balanced and complementing light bitterness; slight pleasant pungency (the description says ""astringency""); light alcohol warmth and evaporation through the nose.  At first I felt this was too thin but as I drank it, it seemed to be come more full; TONS of carbonation, with the beer becoming just a bunch of bubbly froth in the mouth until the beer is allowed to sit and ""burn off"" some of it; slightly sticky after all.  Overall, this is not a knockout beer; what is impressive about it is the sheer craft of the beer; it wont knock you on your ass, but its impressive how subtle and how incredibly well balanced it is, how it all fits how and all aspects of the beer just work together.  I am looking forward to some of the ""heavier"" Trappists.
",5
5358,"Great little bottle. Appearance is amberred with a dull head. First sip reveals a heavy aroma of honey and sugar turning refreshingely bitter.	Great for caf talks and a sturdy meat meal.
",5
5359,"Pours red with a white head.  Smells of rose hips, candy canes, and caramel.  Tastes of grapes, raisins, dates, figs and spring flowers with morning dew.  Mouthfeel leaves a lingering carbonation that tickles the tongue for several minutes after the finish.  Lacing lingers throughout the enjoyment of the beer.
",5
5360,"Wonderful palate. Full of all sorts of fruits & flavours. Well malted - nice and malty like a real ale should be. Excellent head and head retention, but surprisingly, lacked lacing. Cloudy, dark, hazy bottle conditioned appearance and character. Very yeasty. Lots of aroma.
",5
5361,"UPDATED: JAN 9, 2006 (Bottle 33 cl) Muddy brownish colour with a beautiful rocky head. Extremely dry, more dry than bitter. Some chocolatey notes. Not as full-bodied as most other trappists, but still a very beautiful experience. 040993		As ""Chimay Premiere"" 050599
",1
5362,"Medium orange-amber in color.  Thick off-white head (not lasting).  Cinnamon, belgian yeast bright scent, some kind of fruit too.  light bodied.  tastes like sugarless fruit, maybe grapefruit (citrus hopps).  highly carbonated.  Thanks Chuck...
",5
5363,"UPDATED: OCT 23, 2005 Re-rating this fellow, (1992, kulminator, dirk didnt look sure about giving this, so thanks). Aroma is a good aged appely/oakiness, that i normally find this aged beer, i think it could have done with another few years however, fruit and light sweetness that i wouldnt normally have expected from  this being as old as it is. Taste is similar to taste with the apples blending well with the darker fruits to create a delicious beer. I actually found the gf, pauline, had left half a glass left on the table towards the end of the nite and was like bonus if ever there was one.
",5
5364,"Thanks Chuck!  The appearance is a thick, bubbly/creamy off-white head that fully stays.  The body is a weird brown color.  It bubbles more than champagne.  Excellent lacing provides a nice appearance.  The aroma is yeasty, cinnamon, bananas, cloves, grain, apricot.  The flavor is yeasty, hay, alfalfa, cloves, cinnamon, something weird I cant pinpoint.  The palate is watery with a light/medium mouthfeel.  Extremely carbonated.
",5
5365,"an odd orangish brown pour w/ a big thick white head that laces pretty well nice champagne like bubbles but dissapates quickly nocking it from a potential 5 in appearance.  A scent that is yeasty cloves, cinnamon, fruitiness very sweet hints of apricot or bannana in it as well.  Palate is highly carbonated medium bodied.  flavor is sweet and a touch spicy very fruity and malty defintelly belgian yeast almost over carbonated.  Overall a decent beer.
",1
5366,"hazy, dark orange, medium carbonation. I think still a classic dubbel.  The dark friuits play nicely with malt sweetness and a subtle spiciness.  note - put a cork in it and finished the next day and it was still pretty damn good.
",5
5367,"Hazy, cloudy, orangish-brown.  Oily, off-white head.  Aroma is of bananas, brown sugar, raisin bagels, cloves, coriander and cinnamon.  Flavors are similar to aroma, with Belgian yeast, caramel sweetness, vanilla, toffee and cloves being the most prominent.  Effervescent.  Clean sweeping finish.  Peppery aftertaste.  Nicely done.
",5
5368,"Oh so scared of opening my three year olds, I opted for a young batch of this instead (LAm-434). Poured into its own tulip glass, a two inch off-white head formed atop an auburn copper body, with very fine carbonation agitating the bread crumb yeast floating about. Low Cabernet red grape and general vinous aromas, yeasty and earthy. A little toffee for sweetness, but more malty and peaty. Aroma follows through into the mouth, well rounded flavours, light, very fine carbonation, medium bodied, and quite fairy floss sweet throughout, with earthy undertones, leafy hops, gritty malt and a generous dark fruit, almost blackcurrant, zest, that adds a needed balance. Quite Scotch ale peaty, good length in the bitter and lowly sweet swallow, but, like a good red wine, I could tell it was young. I need to open one of the three year olds and see how much theyve matured. A complex and lovely brew.
",5
5369,"UPDATED: JUL 9, 2007 Initially didnt care for this one but now I can appreciate its qualities. Unfortunately, a tad to malty, yeasty and raisiny for my taste. Yet still a very solid ale that gets better as it warms up. Big points for the one finger head that never went away along with the tiny bubbles that continued to rise to the top.
",5
5370,"Not nearly as spicy as the Bleu, but somewhat spicy nonetheless!!!!1112 Deep reddish brown color, and quite carbonated.  Has that Belgian, yeasty, malty taste just not as strong.  But still very drinkable.  Perhaps it is well suited as a breakfast beer.
",5
5371,"Fruity and malty.  One of the only Dubbels Ive had, so Im not sure how it fits into the style.  Not as good as the white and blue, in my opinion.
",5
5372,"(Bottle) A very promising appearance and aroma. -It smells like a classic Belgian with all the right notes of malt, berries, coffee. Flavor is dry, quite full but unfortunately also  very metallic. Damn!
",5
5373,"750ml. btl. i really like this beer. appearance is murky amber brown with a small head that diminishes into little white spots with carbonmation bubbling up  here and there. smells dusty and of dakr dried fruit, with a hint of tea. smells of hops too. the mouthfell is smooth, with a moderate release of gasses. taste like it smells, plus a good deal of malty pleasantness. taste is dry. cheers!
",5
5374,"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2008 Southern sweet tea appearance, Thick but light and frizzy head. Nose of moldy cheese, apple and wine. Taste as same as the nose, with a nice finish. Very unique taste that only a good Belgian can offer. 		Rerate: Amazing. . I love how creamy and vanilla it gets as it warms, but still retains an oaky, fruity slightly bitter side. 		12/12/08 Rerate Pretty damn close to my favorite beer on plant Earth.
",5
5375,"UPDATED: SEP 8, 2009 I have had this one a number of times and really can not say why it has taken me this long to get around to rating it.  Sampled this time from an 11.2 oz brown bottle this brew poured a murky brown color with a faint reddish tinge and a huge creamy beige head.  There is a tart, sweet fruity hop aroma with light sour malt undertones, a touch of mustiness and a hint of cherry nutmeg and caramel. The flavor was tart, bitter and had light touches of fruity and floral hops, cherry, sugar, caramel and a faint musty undertone. The finish was long, sour, tart and fruity. Fairly full bodied. Very well done.
",5
5376,"Aroma:fruity,raisin,camrale....	Appearance:Amber with small head...	Flavor:Raisin,caramel...
",5
5377,"UPDATED: APR 29, 2005 Nice abbey ale, but nothing compared to westvleteren8 (ive had that one in a place  in my hometown). nice hopbitter and alcohol taste. good balance.
",5
5378,"Dirty and astringent nose. Nice color with big carbonation. Dried dark fruit notes are very well hidden.Starchy mouthfeelwith an acidic finish.
",1
5379,"I enjoy how this beer feels on the palate....very light a bit oily.  I feel the flavor is complete and nothing extra, nothing missing.  Its balanced well.  The apricot flavor is most predominate and not overwhelming.
",5
5380,"The predominating maltiness of this beer demonstrates itself mainly in the many dried fruit aromas and flavors...figs, currants, apricots, maybe caramel too...plus a definite alcohol presence.  Nicely done.
",5
5381,"Bottle.  A very dark pour with a foamy white head.  A very strong aroma typical of dubbles.  Very nice blanaced flavor.  Nice hint of spice and slight woody flavor.
",5
5382,"Bottle Pours a hazy brownish red witha nice modest faomy off white head.    Aroma is mainly the musty belgian slant with some light pitted fruit.   Soft woody flavor with that dusty musty flavor.  Not much of the belgian spice but sublte and easy.   Nice.
",5
5383,"on tap, nyc.  Nice dark red, malty aroma.  Sweet malty flavor.  Nice rose pedal palate.  the Blue is better- but this is a hell of a beer.  It has more kick.
",5
5384,"Bottle. Pours dark dark hazy amber with reasonable white bubbly head which did not hang aroud for long. Plenty going on in the aroma, most notible is dried fruit and caramel. This transfers through to the flavour with a dry finish. Mouthfeel a little light for the style. Alcohol barely noticable, this is one that will sneak up on you.
",5
5385,"Pours a dark and sediment filled reddish brown with a creamy off white head. Aroma is fruity, but more your berry type fruity and somewhat malty. The flavor is lightly malty and fruity. A very lightly bitter and yeasty finish. This is very well balanced. Has an initially creamy feel that rolls over the tongue but it seems way too watery for me. My least favorite of the trio.
",5
5386,"This was the first style of Chimay that I ever tried.  I was overwhelmed after the first sip.  It is also incredible, but after trying the blue, the red just isnt the same anymore.  The biggest difference is the bite at the beginning of each sip.  It just isnt as strong as the blue label, plus the blue has a little more alcohol, which never hurts.
",5
5387,"Pours a dark dingy ruby red sort of color. Aroma of yeast and alot of spice. Flavor is quite nutty flavored. Spice fruit and a touch of alcohol. Finish is a little sweet and fruity. Enjoyable.
",5
5388,"Amber orange color with a light malt and hops. Has the taste of a sparkling wine and is a little thin on the texture and body. Not one I finished
",1
5389,"Average frothy slightly off-white head.  Murky amber/brown body.  Slight fruity aroma.  Taste is sweet and almost takes on a champagne flavor.  The finish is very slightly bitter/astringent/spicy.
",5
5390,"This is a good brew for sure, but its just not mind blowing. It just seems standard when compared to other Belgians. It pours a nice and cloudy copper color with a beautiful head. If you have had the blue then you have pretty much had this one, except this one is slightly less complex. With a huge abundance of better Belgians out there, I really dont see myself picking this one up very often. Still worth a try though!
",5
5391,"Cloudy dark red with an off white head. Malty aroma with fruits, plum and licorice. Very balanced taste with a great sweet dry finish.
",5
5392,"Bottle from Nelson Wines. It pours hazy medium brown with red highlights and has a very thin beige head. The nose is sweet fig, date, caramel, wood, tangerine and winter spices. The taste is wood, caramel, smoke, tobacco, orange, orange blossom, dark fruit and honey, with a long woody finish. Theres no denying its a decent brew, but it really lacks the drinkability and complexity of the Bleue.
",5
5393,"From a 33cl bottle from Picks Liquors poured into my Chimay Trappist glass. This beer pours a light brown/ruby. It has a full inch of head that is a dark white color and lasts and lasts. Has a slight smell of caramel and fig. Taste is malty like a fresh baked loaf of bread. It is slightly sweet and slightly bitter. Very good amount of carbonation. Finish is dry and abrupt. Overall, I dislike this beer. I feel that it is the very worst of the Chimay brand. I will not be buying this beer again.

5394,"En versant le tout en verre, une odeur de levure est nettement perceptible. Des armes de pain frais, de noix grills,de caramel, de fruits schs et dpices sont perceptibles. Le liquide de couleur brun lgrement brouill est recouvert dune belle mousse beige et persistante.  En bouche, lamertume, leffervescence et le petit ct piquant rend la dgustation bien intressante. Trs bonne bire.
",5
5395,"Why havent I rated this yet? Well, here goes. Pours a murky, reddish brown. Almost no head. Aroma of caramelized sugar, bread pudding and fig.   Flavor of stone, cinnamon, bread, caramel, and slight toast. Good, but expected and standard for a dubbel.
",5
5396,"Served in a goblet with Thanksgiving dinner 2010.		Pours a medium brownish-crimson color with a single-finger white head with a touch of lacing. The retention isnt the best either, though its certainly a nice color. Nose is dark caramel, purple plum, dates, raisins, and a touch of booze.		The flavor brings forward some notes of lightly-sweetened dark fruits, raisins, and malt along with a fairly strong presence of dates and a nice yeasty character. Medium body with low carbonation and a bit of booze. Drinks fairly well but doesnt have all that much depth.		Serving type: bottle		Reviewed on: 11-25-2010

5397,"UPDATED: APR 13, 2011 330ml Bottle. Pours a deep red/orange/brown with a foamy white head. Aroma of spices, dark fruits, toffee, caramel. Flavour of roasted malts, yeast, spices, dark fruits. Soft carbonation.		Suck on that F**k Society
",1
5398,"Bottle 330ml @ home	Pours cloudy orange with a off-white head. Aroma is funky with notes of malt, caramel, dried fruits and yeast. Taste is medium sweet and light bitter. Body is medium, texture is oily, carboantion is soft.
",5
5399,"This bottle may have been faulty, as it foamed out of the lip of the bottle for a few minutes before I could pour.  When I did, though, it came out normal.  The result is a pretty standard, straightforward Belgain-type strong ae.  Reddish-brown in color with decent foam layering, moderately fruity aroma, standard Belgian strong taste, and wonderful mouthfeel.
",5
5400,"Pours light brune and cloudy, with the well developed lace expected. Spicy, nutty, earthy. Full flavored brew, nutty, yeasty, Belgian spicing. A beer to be enjoyed.
",5
5401,"The dark malty colour and taste of this beer is off set with the fruity aroma and flavour.  There is a lot going on here and I really like it.  The alcohol is hidden well, and there is a lot to smell and taste.  I would place it between the blue and white as it doesnt hold the depth of the blue, or the hoppy fruityness of the white.  It is a great beer overall.
",5
5402,"This one is my favorite of the three. Showing some fruitiness in the aroma and some spiciness in the taste it is very well balanced and easily enjoyed.
",5
5403,"Pours a dull hazy copper with a tall off-white head that lasts. Sweet and fruity aroma with corriander/banana. Taste starts a bit sweet but quickly gets dried out with a crisper spice and hop finish. The red is a bit lighter on the palate.
",5
5404,"Poured cloudy amber, beautiful frothy head. Aroma is very pleasant, wheaty, yeasty. Head lasts, with lacing. This beer is nice on the tongue. Taste is slightly bitter, but the aftertaste smooths to a wine like character. It is overall a pleasant experience that I will drink again.
",5
5405,"Pours a reddish chestnut color with a thick creamy head that lasts forever.    Aroma is fruity - banana and apricot - and spicy.  Flavor is of the same fruits as in the aroma mixed with a peppery spiciness.  Just a bit of alcohol warmth in the finish.  Nice.
",5
5406,"Small Bottle..Chimay goblet pours hazy amber with a light tan creamy head.Funky smell almost like over ripe fruit that has fallen to the ground very earthy but fruity.The Taste is very rich as it should be(at $8.00 a bottle)  .It is a nice malty taste with the presence of mulled spice and yeast notes blending for a unique taste.	Its somewhat thin in body but the carbonation makes for smooth drinking.
",5
5407,"Had this by the bottle at the Boston University Pub.  Slighly drier than the white, if I remember right.  It was okay, but not remarkable for the style.  Not exceptionally strong tasting, though, which is a blessing.  Not something Id go after specifically, however.

5408,"UPDATED: JAN 31, 2006 The nose is salty, lemony, and pilsner-esque, but with a slight altbier tinge.  This one pours a brown amber that is unfiltered with a nice white head.  The mouthfeel is dominated by a thick carbonation upfront that thins out into a medium finish.  The first taste is banana-pepper and perhaps yeast followed by a ""juicy fruit""/fig middle and a medium, dry, and bitter finish.
",5
5409,"Bottle. Color was a reddish brown with a frothy medium head. Aroma medium sweet fruity tone. Flavor was full and smooth and had a long finish with an alcohol bite. Good brew.
",5
5410,"Cloudy brownish red color with a stable white head...lively carbonation.  Grapes, yeast, and other spices.  Dry bready flavor with an uderlying alcohol presence.  Good first trappist ale.
",5
5411,"UPDATED: MAY 2, 2005 Creamy head and dark brownish red color.  Pleasant, fruity aroma, specifically banana.  Medium-full bodied beer although a little boring.  Still always a very good choice.
",5
5412,"UPDATED: APR 11, 2008 Reddish brown body, small head in its glass. Aroma is sugar, bananas, and raisins. Flavor is the same. Slightly metallic. I used to like this a lot more.
",5
5413,"A light bodied double that strangely has hints of rice in it...reminiscent of a Kirin or Sapporo.	I swear I did not have any sushi or Japanese beers tonight.  Shaka Tamasna Kata Frata Brada!!
",5
5414,"Pours more of a light brown than copper, thick head quickly dissapates.  Might be my oncoming cold, but the aroma is quite muted, nothing really prominent.  Fruity flavours with a spicy underlay.  Cherry, dried apricot notes.  Full bodied with a balanced finish.  Cheers!
",1
5415,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2005 Pours a dark brownish color with a nice amount of foamy white head.  Aroma is sweet and spicy.  Flavor is light on the palate, sweet with raisiny spicy finish. Only the slightest bit of an alcohol taste.  Overall, delicious.
",5
5416,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2005 pours a ruby colour with a moderate lasting head. Apricot and Plums in the nose. easy on the palate, refreshing finish, i really enjoyed this.
",5
5417,"Pours (suprise) that usual red color of a dubbel.  Head is thin and lacing is minimal.  Aroma is dried fruit and slight wood.  Flavor is large and malty, very little hop presence, dark fruits, a little veggie, a dry spell with a slight alcochol note, with a mild bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is much better than in the blue, thank God.
",5
5418,"Bottle.  Pours a dark reddish-brown color.  It has a light aroma of light malts and fruits.  It has a slight aroma of hop bitternes.  The taste is mildly sweet, yeasty, malty, and lightly spiced.  This one is also not as good as it used to be.  If I had to compare Id say this one has suffered the least with the Bleu and Blanche really taking hits.
",5
5419,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2008 Rerate, 330 ml bottle, now available in Norway (Vinmonopolet, + Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger): ABV is 7.0%. Hazy brown colour, big and lasting off-white head. Spicy complex aroma and flavour, some winey and woody notes too. The mouthfeel has still too much carbonation, but this is none the less a very fine beer. Im upping it a few points. Original rating: 330 ml bottle, at the White Horse at Parsons Green, London. Served in ""appropriate"" Chimay glass (whether those wide chalices really ARE the most appropriate for savouring complex beers, is a discussion of its own). Unfortunately served far too cold - youd think White Horse waiters knew better. For good measure, the waiter poured the beer along the side of the glass, which prevented the beer from ""opening up"", the head disappeared quickly and the beer kept too much carbonation. The beer has a brown colour, aroma of leather, balsamico vinegar and barnyard. Flavour is quite dry, well hopped, elements of leather and tobacco. Hints of cardamom and ginger. Aroma and flavour improves somewhat as the beer slowly warms up, but altogether this remains my least favourite of the Chimays  - give me a Bleu, please! Still a decent beer, but with the Trappists I expect more. Will re-rate when I personally control the temperature and the pour.
",5
5420,"Hazy brown colour with a big off-white head.	Spicy aroma with lots of yeast.	Complex spicy flavour with sweetness and yeast.
",5
5421,"Chimay Premiere. As my first introduction into Abbey Dubbel was quite pleasing.  I since that first meeting I usally have it as a speacial treat and rare occassions. It is definitly a treat, I think Il treat myself to one soon.
",5
5422,"Chimay Premiere - Beautiful Ruby body with appropriate head. The beer unleashes a perfect blend of spices with malt sweetness. There is definitely something bready in this and an almost warming finish. Good stuff.
",5
5423,"UPDATED: AUG 14, 2005 very nice trappist.  cloned it three times, the ag clone is perfect. toffee aroma w/ caramel flavor.  malty and fruity, it has a rather complex body.
",5
5424,"Aroma was a bit vegetable, almost soapy. Nice lacing, but murky pour. Not unattractive however. Nice bronze color. Flavor was a bit metallic and soapy. Perhaps medicinal. Decent beer, but I would not go out of my way to purchase it.
",1
5425,"Had this one at The Old Toad in Rochester, New York.  Poured cloudy read with a creamy white head.  Aroma was bananas, cloves, and spice, not unlike a hefe.  Taste was sweet and spicy with a medium body.  Not as rich as the bleu, but quite refreshing.
",5
5426,"Dark red/brown color and a medium head size.  The aroma is mighty complex, bready malt smell (a la St. Bernardus,) and a smoked salmon and chesse smell.  Flavor is a good blend of the smooth complex malts and some noticable hops.  There is a definate sweetness to this, but it still comes through with the  tint of flavor of good packaged smoked salmon.
",5
5427,"This is the second of the Chimay beers for me and most likely the last. Got a severe headache after drinking this one.. The color and head are good for appearance but the flavor is lacking, and I running low on Tylenol.
",1
5428,"Has a nice ruddy brown color to it. Fruity and yeasty aroma. Flavor starts of with malt sweetness and assorted fruity qualities. Has some dryness to it to balance things out. It may be the most mainstream Trappist beer, but it still tastes good and is easily drinkable.
",5
5429,"33 cl bottle. Served in Chimay goblet. Reddish bown w/ nice, tan head. Very pleasant and balanced in both aroma and flavor; dominated by malt and subdued spices. Easily drinkable.
",5
5430,"Silky smooth, foamy crown that lingers on, decent if weak aroma of yeast & pale spring flowers. Medium body, slightly watery palate. In my book the weakest of the Chimay Tricolor.
",1
5431,"UPDATED: OCT 31, 2005 A fabulous dubbel. Its a big, full-flavoured ale - I could imagine washing down a big juicy steak with this. It poured a ruby-red colour with a deep caramel head. A big fruity nose - blackcurrant and spices, with some underlying yeastiness. Smooth and creamy on the tongue. Bold chocolate characters amid the fruity middle. Sultanas. Wonderfully easy drinking. A fine cold-weather nightcap. 	(Bottle)
",5
5432,"This is definitely my favorite of the Chimay ales that I have had.  It smells light and sweet, with a hoppy twinge.  Looks great--dark and cloudy with a caramel colored head.  The palate is so complex, with a sweet hoppiness that ive never really experienced before.  Dark malts also reside in this complex, lovely beer.  Great stuff.
",5
5433,"This smacked of quality. It was really a flavorful, complex brew that had weight and substance to it. I liked it, and probably preferred it to other Chimay products Id had.
",5
5434,"Poured a cloudy ruby/amber color with two fingers of head that quickly shrunk to a thin cap. The nose was of toasted malt, cherry and a mild yeastyness. The taste malty sweet tempered with some toasty grain notes. Cherry and alcohol contributes to the flavor creating a nice balance with the malts. The finish was bold and yeasty with light fruity esters. This was tastey and easy drinking. A little pricey but worth it.
",5
5435,"dark amber color with a medium head that shrinks quickly.  Floral smell of hops with a bit of yeast.  Tastes of malt and yeast with a bit of hops.  Nice medium mouthfeel.  Those monks do no how to make a good beer.
",5
5436,"Has more of a dark coppery color, still very attractive.  Has a decent floral, fruity aroma, not overwhelming.  Has a semi-sharp crisp malt flavor. A little bitter somewhat dry, not as smooth as I would like. Fruit is not too noticable on the palate.  Where is that silky sensation?  Still a pleasant and drinkable beer.
",5
5437,"Draft.  Grassy floral aromas.  Yes, coppery in the glass, some nice lacing.  This beer is a palate standout: smooth, buttery and full mouthfeel.  excellent balance.  The esters translate into a lightly bitter finish with a trail of alcohol.  Flavors of almonds, bread, and citrus fruit.  Very good on tap with a proper pour.  I wouldnt rate it as high from the bottle.
",5
5438,"Cloudy, rusty brown.  Nice white fluffy head.  Plum, raisin, malt, caramelized sugars.  More of the same for taste with old hops and a metallic twang.  Bubbly, dry.  Very nice drinkable Belgian.
",5
5439,"Bought a gift pack tonight with the red,white and blue Chimay along with the big chimay glass for $10.99.	Bottle pored a dark caramel color with a medium white head.	Good fruity crisp aroma.	Flavor of malt and hints of alcohol with a 	medium body.	Not bad , maybe a bit to sweet. I think that the white is best.
",5
5440,"Colour: copper red. There is a taste of fruity plums, raisins, blackcurrant and citrus. The flavor is more light compared to Chimay Bleu. The aftertaste is slightly bitter. Overall a very well composed trappist.
",5
5441,"Bottle.  Brown, slight haze, medium beige head.  Malty, with slight yeast in aroma.  Flavor similar to aroma with spicey undertones.  Nice beer.
",5
5442,"Dark pour.  Nice foamy head. Notes of grapes, raison, apricots, cherries and a noticible trail of alcohol.  I would likely choose this over the Chimay blue any day. Very enjoyable and delicious.
",5
5443,"One of my favorites.		Excellent combination of body and taste. Very smooth with a slight maltiness.
",5
5444,"33 cl bottle:  Hazy amber brown color w/a  lasting off white head.  Yeasty, vinous raisin ester, and a little earthy/musty.  Fresh baked bready malt, hints of alcohol, and an every so slight hint of roast with some bakers chocolate & diacetyl.  Well balanced, but is lightly to bitter.  Some roast comes through a little stronger than I remember it in this one and is almost coffee like.  Dry flavor overall in the finish with some herbal hop flavors as well that linger into the aftertaste.  Toasted matl comes through after the roastiness up front.  Very little fruitiness as I also remember it having more.  Highly carbonated, medium body, and lightly astringent.  Alcohol is only lightly noticeable in the mouth.  Overall, I a little disappointed with this beer, or at least this bottle.  I seem to remember it being a little more complex.  Fruity esters are low in the flavor and it seems to be a little over hopped for my taste.
",1
5445,"The strongest and fruitiest of the three Red, Blue, and White beers of Chimay. You cant go wrong with this beer. Serve it with dinner or by itself.
",1
5446,"Just a great beer.  Looks beautiful, rich and full, dark but a hint of orange.  Citrus notes, but not fruity.  Creamy thick head gives way to a smooth but strong beer that lasts forever on the palate and could change your worldview if left to do so.  Try it.
",5
5447,"UPDATED: JAN 2, 2005 750ml. Hazy orange-brown in the glass, with a nice creamy tan head and lacing.  Pleasant fruity aroma.  Flavor is yeasty, fruity, malty, with Chimays trademark yeast immediately apparent. Light in the mouth with astringent and dry finish. Not much alcohol presence and a little thin. Nice dubbel, but not as nice as the price and hype would have you believe.  A little better than the White or Bleu.
",5
5448,"A very fine dubbel. On the bottle is it chimay brune.
",5
5449,"Cloudy brown pour with some orange tint.  Medium frothy head, nice level of carbonation.  Yeast, ripe fruit, spice and alcohol on the nose.  Flavor echoes the nose, lightly bitter.  Dry finish.
",5
5450,"UPDATED: MAY 18, 2006 I find this to be the perfect beer.  Just the right combination of fruity.malty and alcohol flavors. The strain of yeast has a very destinctive taste that you cant find in any other brew. Ver very good ale.
",5
5451,"Bottled.  Pours murky brown with a copper hue.  Hugh creamy tan head.  Aromas of sweet banana and a bit of skunk.  Creamy carbonation with flavor notes of prunes and/or raisins.  Just a bit of bitterness at the end with no alcohol warmth.
",5
5452,"My first taste of the style is still one of my favorites.  Nice balance of sweetness and alcohol.  One I still like to revisit every once in a while.
",5
5453,"33cl bottle, Sampled December 2004	Pours a lightly hazy amber copper color that is topped by a pale amber head that is large and frothy.  The beer is well carbonated with a steady cascade of bubbles rising form the bottom of my glass.  The aroma is typical of the chime yeast with notes of bubblegum, alcohol, fruity notes of plum and raisin, some spicy notes of ginger, all-spice, and clove.  The fruity notes are definitely the dominant ones in the nose.		The taste is lightly sweet, with soft fruity notes of plum, raisin, fig and clove  up front.  The beer then moves to a sharp note that is a mix of carbonation, and yeast derived esters, as well as a bit of alcohol in the finish.  The beer is quite light on the palate, almost a bit too thin.  There is a certain level of astringency in the finish, which I have always found a bit distracting in beer brewed with the Chimay yeast strain.		Overall this is not a bad brew, certainly nothing to get really excited about, but it is a solid beer.  It really could use a boost in the malt intensity / body department though, it just seems a bit thin.
",1
5454,"Warm brown color with some hazyness and fluffy beige foam. Sexy aromas of dried fruit like figs and plums, but also aromas of cookies. Tha taste is intens and well ballanced.
",5
5455,"UPDATED: MAR 27, 2006 Excellent, aggressive belgian beer. Super strong aroma with a nice lasting head. Flavor is a kick in the mouth, very flavorful.
",5
5456,"Pours copper with a thin light tan head. Nose is a sour fruit and spice mix. Plum, raisin, apple, spice, and a bit of sour mix with a slight amount of earthy taste. Bubbly mouthfeel.
",5
5457,"Would you believe I just had this at a Mexican restaurant here in Philly. Poured into a snifter the brew produced a nice creamy head. Smooth on the palate and flavorful throughout the sip.
",5
5458,"Danger, danger, danger.  This stuff is great.  Very full bouquet and a lot of flavor.  If you like a slightly sweet Belgian beer, then this will not disappoint.  Yeah, its trendy, but its good.
",5
5459,"why bother describing it? youve had it. an excellent example of its style. dangerously easy to gulp.
",5
5460,"frankly I prefer teh white. But this has a slight sour cast to and is very drinkable and enjoyable. Crisp yet not biting.
",5
5461,"Amber, off white lasting head. Fresh (sourish) aroma. yeast. bread. Good carbonation. Malty sweet aroma. Brown sugar. Minerals? A touch of hops. A bit thin palate. The ABV is warming.
",5
5462,"Very refreshing nice and fruity, yet bitter at the same time, nice big head as well.
",5
5463,"Better than most beers. Citrus flavor and fruity on the nose. Very nice but I usually go woth the blue.  Perhaps its peer pressure.
",5
5464,"Pours out a nice reddish color with a large fluffy white head. It has a good fruity aroma with a good amount of carbonation. It is a very smooth brew with nice sweet fruity/malty taste with a slight alcohol/hop finish.
",5
5465,"Nice aroma, sweet fulfilling flavor. Pours murky brown with little head, perfect. A++ WILL DRINK AGAIN!!!
",5
5466,"A deep reddish color with a light tan-off white, fluffy head.  Fruity aroma, mostly of darker fruits with slight floral notes.  Medium-full bodied, lightly carbonated and smooth mouthfeel.  A slight hint of lemony hops followed by light alcohol warmth.  Sweet flavor component isnt as strong or complex as the chimay bleu.
",5
5467,"Muddy red. Off white head. Slightly gamy aroma with yeast, spice, some citrus. Good body with some sweetness. Rich and lucious with some fruit and I get a hint of sarsparilla. Overall, very good, but not as complex as some.
",5
5468,"Great beer with a smooth aroma.Nice taste.Also the first trapist beer i have ever tasted.Then i started to fall in love with Trapist beers.
",5
5469,"Schiuma aderente e di lunga persistenza, profumo intenso con un aspetto elegante.
",5
5470,"A very good and smooth beer for a dark beer.  Most beers of this strength (7%) have a very heavy, hoppy taste; at least to me.  This is a strong beer without being overpoweringly strong or too stout.
",5
5471,"Brown thick head, slowly disappearing. The body is dark copper colour and the aromy slightly fruity. The taste is fruity, but a bit more bitter than its cousin the Chimay bleue. No obvious alcohol in the taste, and a milder finish. Very good, but I still prefer the bleue.
",5
5472,"Almost muddy coppery body with orange/caramel glints. Large beige foamy head that gets bubbly after 3 or 4 minutes. Delightful fruity and vineous aroma. The various nuances (raisin, dark cherries, apricot...) makes it quite complex. Taste is characterised by relatively strong hoppy flavors. Alcohol remains well hidden, and the finish is surprisingly mild. Very good stuff... a classical choice.
",5
5473,"UPDATED: FEB 27, 2005  Great Stuff.  The taste is similar to the Chimay Blue but weaker.  The aftertaste is quite pleasant.  This beer is much better in the bigger bottle in my opinion. Even though it is more money I recommend it that way.
",5
5474,"UPDATED: JAN 7, 2006 amber/copper amber color; thick head and lacing - heavy carbonation.  The taste seems to start off sweet and fruity and ends with  bitterness (coffee and nuts are evident as is banana).
",5
5475,"This was probably my first and still my most favorite dubbels on the market.  Very complex and yeasty much like westmalle.  I dont like such dubbels that are overly sweet and cloying.  THis one is a nice deep brown color with a great head and complex sweet and spicy flavors and aromas.  One of the best examples of an abbey dubbel.
",5
5476,"Aroma of malt, flowers, and herbs.  Brown, large white head.  Flavor is complex.  Some bitterness.  Malt, and fruit that seems to hold back.  Heavy palate.
",5
5477,"What a fine looking beer. Pours reddish/honey colored with a beautiful head. Lovely little bubbles that just stay there. Smells clean and crisp. Aromas of flowery malt and just a hint of hops too. The taste lives up the that clean crisp smell. Almost a bit champagne in body with the bubbles whisking by your tongue. The bitterness is mild but present. Just a touch metallic.
",5
5478,"A nice warm copper color with a cream-white head of fine soft sparkly bubbles. Head thins after the initial pour, but a layer of froth lingers nicely. Pleasant clean earthy smells. Some flowery hops. Toasted sugar. As it warms, some candied oranges in there too. Body is smooth and lingers in the mouth long enough to be satisfying, but without cloying. Tastes of carmel and gentle fruit esters.
",5
5479,"75 cl bottle.  Trappist glass.  Pours a nice amber copper with a large tan head.  Decent lacing, head is short lived.  Aroma of fruit, yeast, malt and caramel.  Taste is smooth and creamy.  Flavors of fruit, caramel, yeast, spices and more.  Not much bitterness.  Well balanced.  Excellent !!
",5
5480,"Bottle; 33cl, Beermerchants		Poured into goblet trappist glass, some descent lacing diminishes; descent dark-mahogany appearance. Some deep reds in this for sure. 		Aroma is spices; toffee, caramel, tingling yeast - quite douughey, taste is alcohol, clove, dried figs, raisins, caramel, some soy source, a distinctly raw texture-generally a very complicated brew, ages well though. Its low ibu and can be put down for a long time. 		Over aging the caramel evolves and becomes thicker and the texture becomes more sherry like, the booze is heavy and the candy sugar roles off the tongue. Its a good beer but best in the Kulminator with friends, some cheese and a serious whack of aging. Old beer can be good.
",5
5481,"Bottle. Innisfil, Ontario, Canada.	Beautiful beer! Pours dark tan, good carbonation, head is gone quickly. Excellent aroma - fruits, yeast and caramels, a hint of something earthy. Smooth taste, good back-end bitter. Pretty silky, as described. Big yeast hit. Love this beer - cant remember if I like this or the gold, since this was a big bottle and Im a little tipsy.
",5
5482,"Cant believe Ive not rated this beer yet.  Pours a cloudy dark red with about half a finger of off-white soapy head.  Poured from a 750 ml into a Chimay chalice, I wanted to do this proper.  Roasted malts and some hint of dark fruit in the nose.  A little acidic, light mouthfeel, starts off with a little bit of sharp raisin, that eventually fades into a toasty hop aftertaste.  A solid trappist offering, but for my money, blue is the way to go.
",5
5483,"33cL bottle in Brussels. Pours a hazy brown red. Smells of yeast and light alcohol. Very fine mouthfeel with extremely fine carbonation. Light-to-medium body; feels smooth and caramelized. Taste has some malted barley notes with a slight fruity taste (a bit of cantelope), and a boozy character. A great beer.
",5
5484,"Good beer, I prefer the grand reserve or the white bottle to this, however; this is still a well made beer.
",5
5485,"bottle; dark reddish-brown cloudy with tan head; aroma-malty caramel, fruits; taste-very sweet, fruity, moderate fizz and mild bitterness. Very good
",5
5486,"The beer pours medium tea colored brown with lots of carbonation. The very light tan head rises about 4 fingers then falls relativerly quickly. A soapy full head stays for a while. The retention is ok. 		The aroma is pretty strong with lots of balance. There is dark fruit, light alcohol, caramel and lots of yeast.		The taste is a little boring and light. It starts off with some caramel then gets very yeasy.		The feel is really light.		This is one of the worse trappist beers and a terrible dubbel. Westmalle, westy and achel destroy this.
",5
5487,"Whats not to like?  The signature dusky copper colorisnt the prettiest girl at the dance, but one of the most popular, because of her other worldly charms.  I detected Eves apple in the aroma and flavor.  Spicy and crisp, like a Spanish dancer, but light in body, bold in spirit.  A woodiness that is calming and warms your heart..and gets you drunk enough to lose all control.
",5
5488,"Bottle:  Ruby red with a brown haze, large off-white head.  Quite carbonated at first, make sure to allow this one to breathe.  Spicey nose has yeast, fruits, wheat, and is very malty.  Taste has tons of malt, spicey yeast, dark fruit, and some acidic notes to it.  Decent beer, but theres better from Chimay out there.
",5
5489,"Clear crimson coloration, with busy fizzing above in the beigish head, which dies quickly..nose is spicy, sweet, caramel, and cola, dark fruits and more, but, really, not enough...these days, I expect more from a dubbel. 	In the mouth, tasty enough, but not much more than average...nutty, slightly chocolatey, very light, very lean, leaves the palate quickly, though...and a dull fuzz remains on the tongue, and dies...pretty average, really. 	Boy, this used to be a good beer, I mean, a really good beer, but, this is just kind of dull. Medium bodied, dull, soporific finish...fizzy cola-ish taste...very dull, compared to other Belgian, hey, even, no, especially American offerings!!!	I am damned disappointed in the dullness of this rather dreary, lackluster, coasting- on -the- coattails- of- its- past-kind of brew. 	Its been several years since Ive had a bottle of this, and it may be many more, now that Ive had it again. Its like you get a glimmer of the taste, but it dies too quick, and does nothing...thisshould never be thought of as an exemplar ofthis style, if you really want to try the real stuff...even Maredsous is better than this!	A better beer than, say Milwaukees Best, but not a match for St. Bernardus or even Allagash!
",1
5490,"Amber to nut brown with a huge off-white head, good lacing.  Huge wheat aroma with a sweet and malty nose.  Wheat flavor with caramel notes.  A little dry to metallic finish.  Medium palate, dry and warm.
",5
5491,"Bottle:  Pours a red coppery body, with creamy head.  Aromas of fruit, and hints of vanilla.  Tastes of fruit, and somewhat sour.  slightly feel the alochol on the finish.  I enjoyed this one!

5492,"Reminds me of a shallower chimay bleu. Malty and nice, but Id never buy it next to the blue.

",5
5494,"750ml brown bottle w/cork. Reddish brown, compact off white head. Fruity aroma. Notes of spice, pepper, faint vanilla. Rich malts, some woodiness and more spice in the mouth. A bit of dry finish, some alcohol notes.
",5
5495,"Vary hazy, reddish-copper color with a fizzed up head, much of which remained for the duration of my drink.  Spiced-up, fruity aroma.  Sour alcohol flavor... thats what I tasted right off.  Some dark, dried fruitness to it.  A touch of bitterness.  Ill have it again, but not often.
",5
5496,"Good solid offering from Chimay.  Spicy, yeasty, with just enough richness to satisfy but not overwhelm the palate.
",5
5497,"The Chimay Red poured a cloudy copper-gold.  It had a fizzy fine-bubbled white head that had decent retention.		The aroma was very vinous (red wine / champagne) with some sour notes.		The flavor was strong pear and champagne with smaller notes of alcohol and a little sourness.  Some yeastiness and bitterness came out as it warmed.  The mouthfeel was pretty smooth, but a little fizzy.		Overall, I personally didnt care for the flavor at all (pear and champagne).  I really dont like champagne and this was way too similar for me.  It was pretty well made and did get a little better as it warmed, but I was already tuned into the flavors I didnt care for.
",1
5498,"This beer is wonderful, not as strong as the grand reseve but still has full flavor.  You have to have a glass for this, the sedement is rather bad at the bottle of the bottle
",5
5499,"Just can not say enough about this beer. It has the head of champagne,the color of scotch, the body of a chianti, and the taste of mother earth. Its fruity and earthy and full of both aromas
",5
5500,"Sampled at a shared tasting in Venice, Italy.		Light Ruby.		Unpleasantly aromatic with notes of bread, medicines, seawater, salt, green plants and dark fruits.		Dark fruits reside but the entire front and mid-palate is completely non-existant. The finish however is lovely, lingering and full of a malty sweetness. Once again though, my main problem, as with all the Chimay beers is the total lack of body. This beer still sucks but it blows away that awful Grande Reserve that they also produce.
",1
5501,"Pours beautiful red with a nice ruby head that lasts the whole glass, very nice.  Nose is malt, yeast, and alcohol notes, along with spice that is less sweet (cinnamon/allspice/clove) than spicy (oregano/basil/sage).  When it hits the tongue I think alcohol, bubbles, cherry and red plums, then caramel apples, and overall a strong yeasty, bready note.  To me the alcohol is not well masked in this (as opposed to Tripel Karmeliet or Westmalle, or even Grimbergen).
",5
5502,"UPDATED: SEP 26, 2004 Pours a deep reddish brown with a moderate head that leaves a great lacing.  The initial aroma is malty and yeasty, but as it warms, the aroma gains a spice.  Very smooth and silky.  The taste is malty and fruity, and it too gains a spice as it warms.  The alcohol is well hidden which leads to a very smooth finish.
",5
5503,"Lovely abbey dubbel. Nice murky dark colour with small head. Aroma and flavor is malty with a very delicat fruity note.
",5
5504,"Aroma of cherry which clears the nostrils.  Copper appearance with a thick quickly disappearing head.  Flavours of cherry, fizz and apricot.  Lingering pleasant finish.  Nice as a novelty but wouldnt want to live on it.
",1
5505,"(33cl bottle) The nose is full of yeast and dough that wets the appetite. Upon my pour the beer produced a lovely head, but the head quickly dissipated. The palate is full flavored and refreshingly carbonated. Much of the flavors seem to be either apple or pear. The hops are slightly spice, but restrained. The finish is long sweet and full of rich candi sugar flavors.
",5
5506,"Very carbonated, fizzed up as I swashed it.  Sweet cherries, apricot, alcohol, and malt.  I was kinda dissapointed by this.  A pretty good dubbel, and seems to be pretty easy drinking.
",1
5507,"yeasty with a pronounced banana flavor with other fruit notes.  a good brew.  i must try more by chimay
",5
5508,"Copper/amber color, with a large white/tan head. Aroma is yeast and fruit. Flavor is yeast, brown sugar, and fruit, but they are rather subtle. The end is dry.

5510,"29 Aug 04 Aroma: Gentle sweet spice frit hop malt. Appear: Cloudy deep browns, suds lacing. Flavour: Light fruit hop, easy drinking. Palate: A littel thin, nice level of bitterness, flavour dosent linger and taste is pleasant but not long.

5511,"Malt hop aroma. Cloudy brown colour with good head. Smooth malt hop flavour. Fizzy palate.

5512,"Back around 20+ years ago when I first discovered this I thought it was godly. Have not had it in a few years. WHAT the hell happened?!	 330 ml bottle about 6 mos old. Slightly hazy copper color. Aroma was light fruit and yeast. Flavor was not much differant. Had a hint of spice in the tale end of the finish. Mouthfeel was a bit watery. Highly quaffable tho unremarkable. Not like it used to be.
",1
5513,"Nice dubbel.  Yeasty , alcohol, etc.  Lots of goodness going on here.  Not as good as the Blance or Bleu but still quality.
",5
5514,"Yeast, alcohol, coriander, bitter oranges and cherries in the sweet malty aroma. Opaque, burnished copper coloured with thick, off-white, lasting head. Sweet, brown sugar, caramel malt flavour. Light fruity bitterness cuts the sweetness towards the finish. Medium-full body with nice round mouthfeel. Bottle. Thanks OKBeer!
",5
5515,"Pours a medium brown with a lasting head. Aroma is unpleasant and reminds me of  baby spit-up. Flavor is yeasty and sweet. Has a thick mouthfeel.
",1
5516,"Big bottle at the Electric Factory (another great value).  In your face, overpowering frothy pour.  Once settled, I detect a hint of earthy and mustiness in the aroma.  Dryer and thinner than the Rogue Dead Guy.
",5
5517,"subtle not-so-frothy head from the larger bottle.  Its the first brew Ive uncorked which gives it immediate bonus points! Smells delicious and tastes even more fabulous of a fruity bouquet.  Delicious!
",5
5518,"Grand frothy white head on top of a clear pour that is a tarnished bronze color.  Fabulos-o aroma! It made my mouth water with a beautiful boquet of malts, yeasts, fruit, and citrusy hops blossoming in my nose.  Long lasting flavor with a pleasing hoppy finish.  A slight tart twinge of fruit was a fun...overall well balanced.  A savory brew.
",5
5519,"Finally!  Inspired by an episode of ""The Thirsty Traveller"" that showcased Belgian beers featuring the Orval Monastery, Ive been hunting this beer down by the Pres Trappistes all over my town and finally found a place that had some in stock.  (Very popular ale among beer enthusiasts here, apparantly!)  Upon popping the cork, it pours a beautiful ruby colour with a thick, frothy, long lasting head and a caramel/fruity nose.  Fruit flavours are far more subtle than, say Hoegaarden white, no sharp citrus edge.  An excellent beer to appreciate.  (750mL bottle)
",5
5520,"Pours copper with rich thick head...smells very dry with a hint of alcohol...very wine-like...tastes of caramel and dark fruits...a bit tart...beautiful...
",5
5521,"When you meet a wine snob who turns their nose up at beer, let them try this.
",5
5522,"UPDATED: OCT 11, 2009 A strong cherry-apple aroma - could not detect any other aroma.  Dark brown color with ample brown head.  Taste is spectacular - a perfect balance of fruity sweetness and malt.  Nice full body.
",5
5523,"750ml Bottle: Poured light brown with a thick off-white head that lasted very well indeed and laced thickly. Aroma of subtle clove and caramel malts with a complex spice character. Flavour was banana, subtle caramel malts, and some spice notes. I found the palate somewhat watery, although the low carbonation and bitterness were very nicely executed. This is a nicely restrained evening beer.
",5
5524,"UPDATED: FEB 3, 2007 750ml bottle. Dark red. Really quite carbonated. Sweet, spicy aroma. A smooth, easily drinkable beer, unusual of 7% beers, alcohol hidden well.
",5
5525,"07.26.04  750ml Bottle.  Indeed, a reddish brown pour with a frothy and thick head.  Aromas of banana, milk chocolate, fruit salad, apricot.  Flavors are mild and pleasant, quite fruity and fresh.  Somewhat tinny(?) before a nicely dry finish.  Ive had a few liters of this stuff over the years.  Its a bit pricey, but always reliably consumable.
",5
5526,"A very good tasting beer and very strong.  Has a lot of taste and a noticable taste of alcohol.  A strong beer that is good for sipping.
",5
5527,"Poured a redish color, has a fruity aroma and a creamy head. Flavor is kinda fruity, but bitter. Very smooth beer, and a good one.
",5
5528,"pours a very over-carbonated but pretty amber, with a huge head that is slow to recede, but leaves minimal lace. nose is full of medicinal spiciness, with notes of fruit, earthy hops and alcohol. flavor is quite nice, with a mellow maltiness that is equally balanced by a restrained hop bite, and the yeast tang. mouthfeel is quite light for its strength, as the beer is well attenuated, and the high CO2 content gives further balance. very drinkable for its size.
",5
5529,"Nice reddish, mahoganny color with a creamy off white head..  Nice fruity, yeasty, malty, aroma with a hint of cloves.  Great flavor apricots, bananas with an extra shot of fizziness right up front.  Very palatable.  Like it alot.  Great brew.
",5
5530,"Thick, fizzy, and long lasting head.  Looks like a merangue.  Pours a cloudy, dark brown with an aroma of bananas, apricots, peaches, and sweet bread with a hint of carmel.  Full-flavored and mellow at the same time.  Goes down smooth after a quick fizz on top of my tongue.  malty finish.  Irie Dub.
",5
5531,"Light brown with an off white, large head. Aroma of malt, spices and raisins.	Spicy, fruity, flavor with a subdued hop bitterness. Finishes crisply. My least	favorite Chimay, but thats still pretty	damn good.
",5
5532,"Pours a dirty redish brown, emphasis on the brown.  Small head with good legs.  Aroma is of malt, apples, orange peel, maybe banans, and I swear a little rye.  I think rye.  Taste is of fresh apples, wheat and then there is that rye as well just a little.  Mouthfeel is think but exceptionally smooth with a slight bitterness and sourness in the aftertaste.
",5
5533,"I had the white, red, and blue together tonight (I feel so patriotic!)  and I liked the red slightly more than the white.  Pours coppery, with aroma of fruit (peaches, apricots), hops, and malt.  Tastes fruity, with a fruit, perfumy, floral, velvety and hop finish.
",5
5534,"Fantastic ice-cream head, body segues from rusty red to coppered orange, very fresh yeasty, smacks of ground allspice in the aftertaste. a sweet stab earlier on. Its all the long, satisfying finish.
",5
5535,"UPDATED: JAN 25, 2005 Bottle. Hazy brown, fruity aroma, spicy dry taste. Medium body.
",1
5536,"Hazy reddish brown with a lively beige head. Raisins in the aroma, yeasty, spiced flavour leaves me wanting a little more presence. Medium body. Not bad. Bottle.
",5
5537,"Bottle, 01-04. i also cellaring another for next summer and il rerate if needed. has a cloudy red color with a beige fluffy head that fades. has a raisin/date aroma that is a little sweet. taste has a bite to it. flavors of assorted spice fruit and floral, but is very astringent. finish leaves a malty fruit, mainly raisin like, taste. not bad, i look forward to next july.
",5
5538,"On tap. Poured a reddish brown color. Fruity flower tastes and smells with berry hints (was that raspberries I smell). Very smooth to drink with a dry finish. Very easy and enjoayable to drink.
",5
5539,"Pretty much similar to Chimay Blue, but a little less to it. Still has the spiciness to it. Dark reddish-brown in color. More drinkable than the Blue. Great stuff.
",5
5540,"Bottle. Brown color with a big white head. Fruity aroma with some malt and yeast. Light bosy, a little carobonated, but flavoir had some fruit, malt, and a touch of yeast. Easy to drink.
",5
5541,"Nice reddish brown color with a medium nicely laced white head.  The aroma is mostly fruity and malty. Nice fruity, malty and spicy flavors with a fruity/sweet finish. Light to medium body and an oily mouthfeel, lively carbonation. Although it is not up to its sisters quality, Chimay Bleu, it is a very good beer.
",5
5542,"ive decided this is not style of beer.  too much carbonation, and not enough taste to fill the beer quota.  fruity with a fizzy head. similar to the lambics but less fruit, and more spices.  not enough here to make me a fan by any means.
",1
5543,"UPDATED: FEB 3, 2007 Initial appearance is the beautiful copper coloured beer with a white frothy head,it shouts..""Drink Me!""	It has a nice rounded fruity, maltly flavour and a slightly sour after taste.	You can tell its an abbey beer,but this has to be my favourite one so far - Totally Delicious!!!
",5
5544,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2005 Very nice fruity Belgium. Ive actually only had it on tap never in a bottle. All flavors are evenly weighted of fruits and malt.
",5
5545,"750ml bottle.  Obvious signs of bottle fermentation.  Nice copper colour, tan head.  I have to admit, I was pretty ignorant on this style going in, and so I was very surprised to find in this Belgian beer a great malt character, with hints of bitterness to balance it out.  The carbonation was perfect, and the alcohol was not even noticeable.  Im not sure what I was expecting, but this was very good, maybe without being truly outstanding.
",5
5546,"My serving of this was not all that great, if I can get this served in the propper way and under some better conditions then I will definately re rate this thing. Darker in colour with a big white long lasting head. The nose is mostly wheat and just a dab of malts which gives it a faint fruit presence. The tasete is bitter with some sourness to it. We had this at room temerature as well, dont think that this helped it too much. Different particurally from the white in that there is a nice kick of spice that is just sharp, Nutmeg? maybe?
",1
5547,"Caramel colored body with off-white head.  Aroma of a delicately spiced banana bread. Quite appealing.  Good texture.  Creamy and full bodied.  Flavor was moderately sweet, malty, and a touch of spice.
",1
5548,"Good beer.  Nowhere near as good as the Kid Rock concert I just got back from!  Damn that was good!  Best concert Ive seen in a while.
",1
5549,"Rich reddish brown in color with a frothy tan head.  Definitely can taste the wheatiness and the alcohol.  Sweet smell of flowers and wheat.  Slightly bitter aftertaste.  Overall, delicious.
",5
5550,"The first thing I noticed was the floaties in the bottle. Do not be alarmed by this. Upon opening the bottle, a volcano of froth escaped. Poured, carefully, into a glass it became half head. The smell is acidic, but not unpleasant.  Has a sweetness to the aroma as well. The taste is heavenly. A hint spice (clove?) is present. Something citrusy is going on too.  Bitterness only lasts a moment.  I wish I had another one of these.
",5
5551,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2004 Chimaaaaaaaay! Had quite a bit of floating crap while inside the bottle. Coppery with a big foamy head. Has kind of a metallic smell to it. Has some sort of spicey yeast smell I cant put my finger on. Does kind of have the skin of the apricot smell. Has a smooth dry nutty metallic taste. If this is what monks do then I am in the wrong business.
",5
5552,"A great beer with a dark redcopper color and a nice appearance. Fine caramel sweet smell with notes from dried plums and lightly roasted malts. The taste is rich and fresh,with a round body and a noble sweetness.The afthertaste is bittersweet with a nice ending.
",5
5553,"Not my favorite in the Chimay family but still a great Trappist. This one is kind of like the black sheep in the family; has a bit more ""attitude"" than its siblings. Deep copper in color with a slightly off-white head. Spicy nose with a well balanced bitter taste.
",5
5554,"Deep clouded reddish brown body. Medium foamy tan head. Aroma is malty and sweet with some caramel notes and some moderate spice. Some scents of yeast as well. Taste is nice! Malty and rich with more spice, yeast and some lighter caramel notes. Some dark fruit tastes in there as well, maybe plum or raisins. Everything is blended together well. Nicely balanced and filling. Mouthfeel has a fair amount of carbonation mixed with some spice. Finish is rather fruity and spicy. Another beer I cant believe I hadnt rated yet. Nice to revisit this one!
",5
5555,"Very Good Chimay.  Deep Gold Color.  Strong, but well balanced.  Yeast Flavor as well.
",5
5556,"i had chimay for the first time the other day. i was very impressed. it has a high alcohol content but no bad taste. very smooth.
",5
5557,"pours a deep orange with a beautiful white head with a wonderful white  lacing.  Aromas of that belgian yeast that we have come to lovem but its not that strong.  Flavors are bitter yet sweet with doughy and citrusy flavor... this may be my favorite of all the chimays ue to that balance and flavor.
",5
5558,"750ml bottle. Banana, spices, yeast and alcohol aroma. Malt is there but quite subdued. Not full bodied with alcohol very noticeable despite strength. Over carbonated and dissapointing.
",1
5559,"Bottled. Nice head which disappeared quickly. Extremely well-balanced with nice fruity/bready malts. The wonderful, fine carbonation contibutes to what I believe is the best palate of any beer Ive come across yet. Many of the American imitatitions have been over-done; Chimay gets it right; these monks know their stuff.
",5
5560,"There were floaters in the middle of the large bottle and noticeable sediment on the bottom.  It poured a big off while head with popping bubbles.  It was mostly diminishing.  At first the color in a full glass reminded me of plum wine, but slightly lighter and with a little orange.  Small bubbles rose from the bottom of the glass.  Initially, it felt lively on the tongue and released a flavor that is hard for me to describe.  After a short bit the liveliness died down allowing it to become smooth all the way through.  It had a nice full round mouth feel that was clean after the swallow.  The flavors started with what reminded me of warm doughy bread with a hint if nuts.  It ended with a pleasurable metallic astringency, which lightly remained in the after taste.  If drank quickly it has a sharp harshness that quickly builds up.  It is a very good beer that I will have again.  The reason for the lower aroma rating is because I have not been very successful in telling the difference between beers for a while.
",5
5561,"330ml bottle: After drinking this for so long, I finally getting around to rating it: pops with lively carbonation, and pours with a moderate, creamy head; nutty, caramel aroma; herbal, citrus hop and light dough nose; hints of banana, clove, bubble gum, pear, pepper and toffe flavor; finishes with a long, slightly metallic  astringentness.
",5
5562,"Pretty good, full of flavour, wonderful smell. Good beer to sip and savour
",5
5563,"My comments on the ""Blue"" follow ( the ""Red"" is almost there) ... Blue -Just a superb Trappist rendition.  I love the yeasty fullish bodied content, the red-copper color, the Belgian lace and overtones of malted caramel among other enticing flavors.  The best of the Chimay line.
",5
5564,"UPDATED: DEC 30, 2008 Bottle:  Aroma is very fruity.   A little hop aroma too.  Pours a very hazy copper with lots of sediment.  Nice off-white head with a good amount of retention.  Not much lacing.  Very malty and fruity tatste.  No hops in the taste like the smell indicated.  Slight alcohol taste, but for the most part covered up rather well.  Virtually no aftertaste.  Alcohol taste intensifies as you drink but never becomes overpowering.  Excellent beer.  Bleu gets the higher average rating, but I think this is much better. (8-4-8-4-17)		Bottle (33cL):  Well, its finally time for a re-rate.  The aroma is moderately fruity with raisins, grapes, faint apples, candi sugar, yeast, and light spiciness.  It pours a hazy reddish-orange with a moderate off-white head with decent retention.  The flavor starts with moderate fruitiness thats just like the aroma with a nice mixture of raisins, grapes, and faint apple.  There some slight candi sugar in the background.  The finish is somewhat spicy with some metallic notes that are somewhat iron-like.  Medium bodied with a nice smooth and creamy mouthfeel.  As the beer warmed the iron flavors began to disappear, but never disappeared completely.  My score probably wouldnt be all that much different than before if not for the iron-like flavors in the finish.(9-4-6-4-14)
",5
5565,"redish, or lighter brown in color.  Smelled of fruit and as usual with Chimay, plenty of carbonation.  A great beer but not the best of the chimay line.
",5
5566,"Hazy brown body with a foamy lasting off-white head. Aroma is sweet of berries, malt and fruit. Flavor is roasted malt, yeast and some liquorice. A little mild in the flavor but still a nice beer!
",5
5567,"Small bottle from the Chimay gift pack (I just wanted the glass). This is the last one of the Chimays that I havent tried. This one is nice and fruity overall. Some hop/malt showing through as well. Overall I like the grand reserve better but not bad at all.
",1
5568,"33cl bottle poured into a goblet.  The beer smells fantastic....with notes of fruit....plums maybe.  The beer pours a nice reddish brown, like a true dubbel should, and leave a nice off white head with large champagne size bubbles.  Taste is fruit up front, noting tastes of fruit again, sweet, but with a dry finish.  The hops provide just the right amount of hops to keep this from being too sweet.  Very well balanced, with some linger bitterness.  Palate is medium body with lively carbonation.  Overall, a great classic dubbel.  This really hits in all the right places.  Very, very good.
",5
5569,"Clear brown with a beige head. Aroma is sweet, malty, caramel, yeasty and light spicy. Flavor is quite sweet and light bitter. Light dry and spicy finish. 250311
",5
5570,"Pour is a deep red brown color with a decent sized white head. Nose is of dark fruits and yeast. Taste is mostly of fruits, maybe with some earthy notes. Extremely light, and very well carbonated.
",5
5571,"Bottle.  Deep, translucent red and orange color with a large semi off white head.  Yeasty bread aroma with just a hint of fruits showing up.  Fruity flavor with, some sweetness, and some clove-like spice.  Medium bodied.  Prefer the blue and white to this, but it is still pretty solid.
",5
5572,"Dark red colour with a good head, very nice brune, it says Brune on the bottle but is known as Chimay Red?

5573,"Bire cuivre sur lie, lgrement trouble avec un gnreux col beige mousseux.  De complexes armes herbacs, de gazon, de pomme verte, dalcool et mme de caf!  Bire plutt acide et lgrement minrale.  De corps moyen.  Texture lisse et plaisante avec une fin honnte.  Probablement agrable avec des repas pics et armatiques.
",5
5574,"bottle@home: least impressive of the Chimays, heavy on dark red fruits & malts, some caramelised brown sugar, spice, minor spiced hops, middling, bit thin body
",5
5575,"An absolutely beautiful beer - deep cloudy orange/brown with a fluffy natural head.  Scent of fruit and hops. Sits nicely in the mouth - nice carbonation and a full flavour leaving a slightly bitter aftertaste.  A big tasting brew with - believe it or not - a mildly ""fishy"" taste.  Overall, a classic.
",5
5576,"The pour was most interesting, it kept foaming out of the 750 ml. bottle. I only wanted to try a few sips! Medium brown color with large but dissipitating head. Good smell with spice and some fruit, which did not disapoint in the tasting. Semi-dry aftertaste.
",5
5577,"UPDATED: NOV 20, 2006 (Re-rate, prev. 5/5/04,6-3-7-3-15). Dark brown colored, vasnihing light brown head. Lively carbonation. Spicy and licoricy aroma with sweet caramel tones, yeast and mild alcohol.  Medium to full bodied, surprisingly high carbonated. Flavor is not as rich as aroma: caramel, bubbling carbonation with obvious yeast, alcohol lasts in aftertaste with sweet caramel and biting sourness.
",5
5578,"One of the beers that introduced me to how complex a beer can be.		Tasted it on the weekend, just wasnt the same.  It was ok, but not like a few years ago when I tried it.  My guess is that this is the belgian most folks have when they first start to understand how good a beer can be.  There are too many beers out there better than this, but still a solid pick.
",5
5579,"Pours a nice copper color with a lasting head.  Quite carbonated and lively.  Fruity, spicy aroma and flavor.  Well-balanced between malt and hops.  Overall, an excellent beer and one worth savoring.
",5
5580,"Pours a vary dark amber brown Colour with yeast in the glass. Nice big head which kinda lingers. Aroma is lively with scents of hops, fruits, spices, and other added flavorings. Tastes like a Dr. Pepper on Steroids, with hints of Raisins, Caramel, Pecan, other nuts Pie crust and the custard of a Pecan Pie. This beverage is Highly carbonated and yeasty which greatly contributes to the overall enjoyment of the beverage. A dry nutty finish brings this distictive Malty brew into a realm that for me doesnt quit match up to its bigger brother the Grand Reserve but is a very good alternative. Kudos to Chimay. Bon Appetite!
",5
5581,"Hazed garnet hue, frothy cap that holds a real Brussels lace and holds it to the end of the glass.		Smells of bread pudding with a hint of medicinal clove, . Sweet raw honey-like malt aroma. Starts very smooth and silky with a rolling viscous carbonation that plows though peppering the tongue with ginger-clove tastes and malty sweetness with a hint of birch. The finish is rather dry with a fascinating herbal sweetness left on the tongue. This is an abbey beer fit for serving with a rich meal.
",5
5582,"Color is the dull red-brown of autumn oak leaves. Small but insistent ecru head. Promising aromas of candi sugar, spice (nutmeg/clove/anise), candied fruits, chocolate-covered raisins. Flavor is complex, but eludes an accurate description; the closest I can get is amber malts, dark rye bread, almost-chocolate, fig, mineral water, and a very light acidity. Some (noble?) hop bitterness rears its head and then fades away in the effervescent, fluffy mouthfeel. Finishes dry with an aftertaste that is vaguely chocolate, lightly peppery and nutmeggy, cocoa powder, and... fresh parsley? Tastier than blue or white label, in my opinion. I could imagine pairing this with turkey or pulled porked, with mole sauce.
",5
5583,"Pours a milky brown color with yeast all over. Aroma is that of wine, alcohol, and medicine. Flavor is fruit, apples, apricot, and yeast. Very much like wine. This is a style that takes getting used to. Overall, interesting.
",5
5584,"Quite sweet, I couldn't taste the alcohol in this. Bitter towards the end. A slight disappointment but enjoyable none the less.
",5
5585,"Rica cerveza de abadia (fermentada en la botella) con ligero sabor afrutado.
",5
5586,"UPDATED: FEB 24, 2011 Tart and fruity nose with a bit of cellar mustiness. Pours deep and cloudy coppery-red with a thick, lasting off-white head. Sparkling character dances on the tongue. Starts with a lightly sweet fruit winey flavor which mingles nicely with a bittering quality near the very dry finish. A hint of cherries in the aftertaste. Very quenching.
",5
5587,"Very nice brew. Smooth, full of flavor, tasty. Don't really have anything negative to say about it. I'll sure try some more of this.
",5
5588,"Lighter in color and lower in alcohol than Chimay Bleu.  The aroma is like that of a fine bakery.  you will be able to taste 7% alcohol, but that will not interfere with your enjoyment.  Although still a sweet ale, the taste is surprisingly dry given the high gravity and fruity aroma.
",5
5589,"Very yeasty citrus and wheat aroma.  Yeast and malt flavor with a bit of tangyness.
",5
5590,"Tastes like Chimay Blue if blue was not filtered. Again, I have to state that trappist beers are not my thing, and red did not change my mind. Strong nose of malt, yeast, and alcohol. Taste hangs out with you for a few minutes after drinking. There was something wrong with this beer that I can't seem to put my finger on. I think that if people tasted this blind and did not see that it was a Chimay coming out of an attractive bottle, they would give it much lower ratings. IMO, a very overated beer.
",1
5591,"Copper in colour with sweet fruit and yeasty aromas. Flavor wise, it begins quite sweet, but dries quickly and becomes bitter with some earthy/oaky qualities. The alcohol is also very upfront. An interesting contrast to Chimay blue, which (in my mind) is a far more subtle and delicate product. Thanks presario.
",5
5592,"I've had this before and this isn't the best bottle I've had. Marks are adjusted accordingly. Cloudy brown with a gigantic white frothing head. Moderate lacing. Some sediment. I remember all the bottles at the LCBO this time looked a little weak, and the yeast looked a little mucus-y. Regardless I don't think the bottle had spoiled. Aromatic spicey, chocolate, fruity, soapy with notes of cherry scents. Prickley spiced flavours. Body is medium, relatively rich and bread crustiness is prevalent. Carries some yeasty sourness. There is a dominant flavour in the first palate (can't figure it out) which doesn't work for me. Not as complex as the white or the blue. Good none the less.
",5
5593,"One of my all time favorite beers. Pours a beautiful copper color. Nice light white head. Smells of faint fruit, some alcohol and spice. Drinks smooth and clean, works extremely well with creamy goats cheeses.
",5
5594,"slightly cloudy, dark copper/brown, thin white head, very fruity and yeasty, maybe a hint of alcohol, lightly hopped, grass, very distinct fruitiness  some cherries, prunes, citrus; flavor is sweet and fruity, some bitterness and alcohol, definite yeast presence, earthy and lightly sugary  malty as well, not overly complex but well done
",5
5595,"Bottled	Dark copper brown hazy color. Pours excellent long lasting off-white head. Aroma is excellent: malts, prunes + citron-like alcoholic touch. Easy to drink despite being quite full-bodied malty. Palate is not extremely complex. Gives alcoholic kick in the finish.
",5
5596,"What oh what has happened at Chimay?  I first tried these beers in the Brugse Beertje in 1991 and liked them a lot.  The red, in particular, was strong and complex and I decided there and then that if this was Trappist beer I liked it.  However, recent tastings have left a bad taste in the mouth in more ways than one.  The colour is the same, but the aroma is wheaty and vegetal.  The body has vanished almost completely, with only a thin wheat, cardboard and chemically taste present, fading out quickly.  They say the recipe hasnt changed in years.  I dont believe them.  This beer is now unpleasant to drink.  Go and buy some Westvleteren instead.  (bottle in Trappiste, Altrincham)
",1
5597,"Outstanding. Without question, one of the best beers I have ever tasted. Creamy head, reddish coloring. Extraordinarily fruity/flowery taste with hints of berries and slight bitterness...complex flavors without being too ""heavy."" Excellent finish and aftertaste...reminiscent of cloves. Temperature variations seem to have negligable effect on qualities of drink. Unbelieveable!
",5
5598,"Bottle - nice yeasty, fruity aroma.  Dark gold to light brown in color with a finely bubbled white head.  Tons of floaties!  Amazingly creamy mouthfeel.  Malt and yeast fade into a hint of mild bitterness.  A beautiful beer.
",5
5599,"Bottle pours light caramel, small fizzly white head, with tons of little yeasty bits floating about.  Aroma is typical belgian yeastiness.  Light fig/date on the flavor, more belgian yeast, finishes tart.  While not overly carbonated, it seems to generate the largest burps.  Tiz alright, but seems as if it could use more flavor & spices. 
",5
5600,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2004 (Bottled, BBE 2007) Reddish brown, slightly orange color with a medium, tanned head. Crisp, ""Chimay-yeasty"", slightly sweet and sour aroma with a slight smokiness. Fruity and surprisingly refreshing, wineous flavor with lots of yeast and berries. Sweetish, and a bit sour. Full-bodied, oily, refreshing, sticky, lightly wineous and quite carbonated - although very tolerable - palate. An excellent, complex and refreshing trappist. These guys do know how to brew!
",5
5601,"Poured a deep red hazy amber. had a medium sized fine head that quickly thinned to a small head. Fruity aroma. Fruity flavor with hint of grapes and cherries. Very smooth drinking with fruity aftertaste. This is my favorite of the Chimays(over the bleu)
",5
5602,"Finally got to rate this after drinking numerous times. Large bottle. Dark brown with ruby glow, bit white head. Yeasty/banana aroma with some spice, maybe cinnamon and clove. Not as complex as I remembered (still complex though), firm body with malt and more spice, some bitterness, dry malty finish. Nice.
",5
5603,"Me and my ratings ... this was the first Chimay that I tied and the last for me to rate .. unless I get my hands on some of the rarer stuff. What can I say other han I can still remember he first time I tried it. Prior to working for distributor a friend that worked for them brought a 750 to share at dinner at Brazilian restaurant. She watched as I had my first sip, knowing fully well that I would love it. Always think of the yeast first, then the rest follows .. malt and finally hops to finish it. Hope that they can survive the horrors of modern day technology and al he other plagues of mankind so that we can have good beer. I pray for the brothers.
",5
5604,"Pours a small head that lasts forever over a cloudy red body, a smooth creamy palate. Cloves and banana. Flavor is pretty much a one hit of the same with malt.

5605,"nice copper colour. almost pinkish. big off-white head. great fruity taste, grapefruity, and bitter.

5606,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2005 	Pours a rich, creamy head that lasts the entire drink. Body is dark amber/brown. Head is an off white colour. Aromas of spices, plums, some rum, and fruit. Taste is fruit, floral, run, prunes. FInish is spices in the aftertaste, smooth and full bodied. This is my second re-rate of this beer. FOr some reason as of late, it seems to be almost watery. Still really good, but not as good as I had first thought.
",5
5607,"i like this one more than the blue now.  seems to me more versatile and drinkable.  the ultimate belgian brown/dubbel ale for me.  tastes best room temp, though not as refreshing.  and for whatever reason, always tastes better in the big bottles.   yay!
",5
5608,"Another great Trappist ale although I think this one is a little bit overrated.
",5
5609,"UPDATED: OCT 2, 2004 Big foamy tan head on an acorn/copper colored body. Has a fruity aroma with big bursts of malt, and yeast. and  This beer is filled with big malty flavors, doughy yeast, light hops, and smooth alcohol. At first I thought it was a little bit overcarbonated but once it settled in the glass it was just perfect.
",5
5610,"A great trappist beer. The best thing about it is the color, never have I had such a perfect color. Head did not last very long however, weaker flavor than I was expecting.   Great beer nonetheless.  Not sure which of the Chimay selections is best...
",5
5611,"REALLY GREAT RED BEER.  THIS BEER IS BEAUTIFUL FULL OF BODY AND HAS A GREAT HEAD.  VERY SMOOTH AND GOES DOWN EASY
",5
5612,"bottled:  when poured into a trappist glass this beer is beutiful, thick and creamy tan head that is chunky in texture, brown hazy fluid underneath.  a nose of bready earth with some spiciness to it.  malty flavor with yeast inbeded bread taste and clove toffee feel.  well balanced on the palate and easy to drink. more 'gulpable' then most in this class. no alcohol taste at all.  i enjoyed this beer, because of its drinkability. most in this class you sip slowly. i suppose the bleu is a bit more robust higher alcohol and a more 'sipable' beer.  want some, get some....trappist beers that is!
",5
5613,"Dark red color with decent sized head poured into a Chimay glass. Floral and spicy aromas. Nice hop bite if you look for it. I like the Blue better.
",5
5614,"Cloudy brown with very little head. Mildly spicy & fruity. Finishes dry with little bit of sourness.  Just a bit of hops too.  Very balanced and flavorful - a must try.
",5
5615,"aromas of floral hops and belgian yeast. some spiciness in the aroma.	some malty nuttiness, sweetish fruits like white grapes, caromel, cookie dough, hop bitterness, floral flavors. Fairly light  compared to like rochefort. still kicks the ass of a lot of beers.
",5
5616,"I love this beer! I like the Whole CHimay line, as a matter of fact. A great fruity/spicy taste. A good beer anytime you are in the mood. A great dinner beer or desert! I like the tripple a little better.
",5
5617,"Copper red color. Substantial head. Fruitiness and spice more apparent as it warms. Slight bitter finish.
",5
5618,"UPDATED: MAR 28, 2004 light copper color, medium head with so-so last.  not as cloudy as I like an ale of this sort, yeast kind of playing it cool.  good drinking beer when you're ""having more than one"" and overall very mild for [a trappist ale] my liking.
",5
5619,"Cork almost made my friend single again, and quite possibly compromised the structural integrity of his apartment.  This was just magical.  First beer of the night!  Amore!  Cloudy amber, excellent head and head retention.  Wonderful maltiness and a creamy mouthfeel.  I didn't find it too astringent.  It had an aftertaste of fresh-baked bread.  I am SO thankful for the peer pressure on this site, or I never would have discovered this!  Forgot to mention, the 7%ABV was masterfully hidden.  I had no idea till I looked!
",5
5620,"Bottle, BB 2007.  Great looking dark amber-brown with an enormous white head. Wonderfully complex aroma, with notes of raisin, caramel, yeast and warm spices.  Some notes of pepper and a bit of alcohol sneaks through.  Very smooth in the mouth.  Has a dominant raisin character, slight sweetness with a long herbaceous finish ending in crisp hops.  Taste is not as complex as the smell, but still a fantastic beer.
",5
5621,"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2008 [bottle] Very cloudy and dark ruby color with a thick head. Sort of looks like cider. Very pleasant malty aroma with a nice earthy followup. Good malt flavor with a wonderfully silky mouthfeel. Very balanced with a nice lightly bitter finish.
",5
5622,"Dirty amber with frothy white head.  Aroma is somewhat fruity, malty, and yeasty with a strange muskiness(maybe I got an old bottle).	Mouthfeel is soft and creamy? with medium carbonation.  Flavor is sweet malt and candi with a tinge of spice in the finish.  Do Monks really make this?
",5
5623,"Pours a reddish brown with a nice thick long lasting head. Fruits and spices in the aroma which of course transfers into the taste. Cinnamon, clove, bread, mild hops and a nice finish. Currently trying to age a few.Yum.
",5
5624,"Pours beautifully with a nice off white foamy head. The color is amber orange and the smell is of fruit, but not too fruity. tastes excellent in the mouth and is very smooth. One of my favorites.
",5
5625,"Bottled:	Deep, rich red hue with a fine, creame colored head.  Malt forward with aromas of bread, banana, cream soda, subtle hop character.	Tastes of maltiness with sweet foral esters, mild hop balance.  Like a loaf of bread fresh from the oven.	Dry finsh with good, thick mouthfeel.		Nice.
",1
5626,"Made by monks to make you pray for forgivness after too much of a rich and heady delicious thing.	Spanner.
",5
5627,"UPDATED: DEC 30, 2009 Beautiful copper colour and candy sugar aroma.  The mouthfeel and aftertaste are both very pleasant with gargly candy sugar notes.  Obviously not a session type drink but one I would pleasurably return to time after time.  Score 4.0Subsequent rating scored 3.8. Average becomes 3.9
",5
5628,"Malty aroma emerges from a very cloudy chocolate brown beer topped with a light tan head. Sweet with bits of spice thrown in: sweet turning very slightly bitter aftertaste. Nice.
",5
5629,"750 ml. big 'ole brown corked & caged Belgian bottle. Bottling date of 1/02/03. January 2, 2003 was a good day for bottling Chimay, because mine is wonderful. Poured out a hazy, rusty orange color.	The cork shot out of the bottle first. Very effervescent, highly carbonated. Huge head at first, mocha cream in color. Slowly slid back to a thick matting, and even more lacing down my Chimay chalice. Huge island of yeast floated in the middle of the beer.	Aromas are of caramel malts, lactic wheat tang, fresh cut hay, slight earthy & slightly musty aromas as well. I could go on describing this beer all day, because it is so complex, and so well made. Only 1 point off for cloudiness. Other than that, it was perfect. Tastes the same as it smells. Slight lactic wheat tang, enormous malty backbone supports the hops very well. Noble hops make an all too brief appearance towards the end. Bready, yeasty bite, and smooth mouthfeel make for a great beer.	I wish I lived down the road from this Abbey.
",5
5630,"UPDATED: JUL 19, 2004 750ml bottle.  Pours reddish-brown with a large, lasting, fluffy head.  Aroma is mildly malty with some yeasty notes, but uninspiring.  Thin body yields simplistic flavours that disappoint.  The typical full, sweet, and fruity flavours that one expects in a Dubbel are only vaguely apparent, with more off-putting cardboard flavours in the background.  There has been a lot of controversy surrounding Chimay over the last few years concerning ingredients, recipes, and cost-cutting, but who knows where the truth lies?  Having enjoyed this many times in the past, I can only say that this is not the same beer that built Chimays worldwide reputation, nor the beer that will sustain it.  	Update (7/19/2004):  750ml bottle, aged 18 months.  The aroma and flavour have a much more pronounced dark fruitalmost vinouscharacter.  Slightly fuller mouthfeel.  Less of the cardboard taste.  Probably gains a few points here and there, but still very disappointing.
",1
5631,"UPDATED: APR 18, 2004 Poured from 330ml bottle. Strong aroma of cherries and currants. Head was creamy, with no lacing in my Chimay glass. taste of raisins and malt. Wet and smooth finish. The warming effect comes gradually, with no alcohol bite.  This dubbel is nearly a perfect winter beer.
",5
5632,"Very creamy head.  Nice fruity aroma.  Soft, thick, creamy on the tongue.  Well balanced.
",1
5633,"Deep red color with big head and high carb. Fruitty smelling. Prune and raisin taste with a yeast notes. This is a great beer to introduce drinkers to Belgium Beers.
",5
5634,"UPDATED: MAY 13, 2007 Tawny brown colour. Dense head. Malt in the aroma, but more muted than I expected. Sweetish malt flavour with a  somewhat coarse yeasty sourness. Quite sharp finish which subsides leaving a residual sweetness. Fine, but nothing exceptional here, in my view.
",1
5635,"Another fine brew just like belgium know how to make them. Little head, sweet and fruity aroma, excellent mixture of sweetness  and spiciness witch make it a really enjoyable and easy to drink brew. You can't really taster the alcohol. Bitter finish.
",5
5636,"Medium-dark, brown body with some red hues.  Head is eggnog colored and thick, packed heavily with bubbles.  Smel is typical abbey: lots of malt, clove, sweet corn, vegetable hops an some dustiness.  Looks perect in glass. Tate is just strong enough with dark fruits, currants and spices. Delicious malt blankets the taste buds wrapping a warm alcohol flavor.  After taste is good: rich malt, grapes and warming from the alcohol
",5
5637,"brown hued but lacking depth of color, very cloudy, perhaps I let the bottle expire,  some spiciness upfront, decent fresh baked bread taste, I'll have to try again, not up to par with corsendonk or allagash double
",5
5638,"Dark oarnge/light brown. Nice,creamy,long lasting head. Nice yeasty,malty aroma. Very creamy,fizzy,mouth feel. Feel great in the mouth. Starts musty and bready,rich. Chewy yeast follows,with fruity malt flavors. Finish is has the slightest bitterness,and is mainly malty. I've always enjoyed this one.
",5
5639,"A sparkling clear copper body is topped by a frothy tan head. The aroma is yeasty and quite malty. The flavor has a certain spiciness about it that is quite nice, also sweet malt and yeast come into play.  Body is medium and the carbonation, while quite lively in the glass, is not overly so on the tongue. Pre-RateBeer this and the Ommegang brews were about the only Belgian-style beers I ever drank. I quite surprised at how well this beer stands up to the many other Belgians I have had since joining RateBeer. It is not in the Westvleteren class of Trappist brews but it is still quite a beer. The gift pack that includes all three standard Chimay beers as well as a Chimay chalice is a steal.
",5
5640,"POP! Cork almost slipped from my hand, could have almost hit the ceiling, and the bottle rocked.  (As in, it wobbled on the desk, but it rocked in that it's a cool bottle, too).  Sweet aroma, smooth and balanced smelling.  Banana and berries and spice and something lightly musty but nice.  Hazy orange-red color with a good head that stays a bit.  A bit of lacing.  Slightly sharp on the tongue, some alcohol taste, but not overpowering.  Light sweetness and a bit of maltiness and spice.  Good bitter finish.  Lots of sediment at the bottom of the bottle.  Fairly smooth in the mouth, a tiny sting going down, but no point loss for that! Good.
",5
5641,"I enjoyed pouring this beer into my newly acquired Chimay Glass.  JUst felt right...Not much to add about this fantastic dubbel...Nearly perfect for the style..Nicely played
",5
5642,"Another great brew from Belgium.Do these guys ever take a break?A nice rustic autmn copper color with a foamy head that dissapates to a creamy texture.Very malty and hints of fruits and the alcohol was slightly hidden.The finish was clean with a little bit spiciness
",5
5643,"UPDATED: SEP 16, 2004 From a small bottle came a huge fruity,red faced warming experience.Good malty fun.
",1
5644,"Great color that is best described as rusted pumpkin. Head retention is unbelievable. Taste is barely sweet, and not too bitter- gives a mild overall feel. Mouthfeel could be more malty, but this beer comes off very smooth and drinkable. Good bitter aftertaste, decent malty aroma. Quite mild, but still a success.
",5
5645,"Beer 31 Belgium trip.  An old favorite, and my introduction to Belgian beers all those years back.  Medium brown, bit hazy, light notes of port and raisin.  Flavors matched, with a bit of piquancy, light malts.  Good, and will always hold a soft spot for this one.
",5
5646,"UPDATED: FEB 4, 2004 Pours very cloudy ruby with a moderate head.  Very strong lace.  Aroma is very malty withapticots and a little smoke.  Flavor is similar.  Fruity without too much sweetness.  Slightly bitter finish with a dry aftertaste.  The alcohol is not very noticable in the flavor, but you can feel it later.  Thinner than the blue.  Lots of carbonation.  A very nice mild Belgian dubbel.
",5
5647,"Hazy copper with only a small head. Mild fruity aroma. Fruity malt taste--I noticed apricots primarily. Well carbonated.
",1
5648,"Slightly cloudy, nice natural carbonation. Slight winey flavour/fruity taste. Lots of flavour. Strong yeasty flavour. Nice ale.
",5
5649,"Poured a copper color with a small off white head.  The color was not was I was used to seeing in a dubbel, and it didn't include any lacing.  Aroma of citrus, with some dark fruits as well.  Taste was filled with grapes, plums, and some citrus and spice as well.  Overall, I was expecting alittle more out of this after the bleu being my first Chimay, and I loved that.
",5
5650,"Pours a hazy and murky brown-tanish color with a robust white head that leaves nice lacing.  Aroma is very fragrant--bananas, spices, yeast, citrus.  Start is sweet with some citrus/banana taste turning into a smoky/rose flavor, finally ending in just a mild bitterness.  A very well-balanaced beer.  I prefer this over the white.
",5
5651,"Pours a hazy copper color, with a large frothy off white head.  Very attractive aroma, malty with nice fruitiness.  Good amount of carbonation, kind of a spicy fruit flavor, very nice bitter ending.  A wonderful beer, many thanks to my brother for sharing this beer with me.
",5
5652,"malt and dried apricots on the nose, beautiful dark copper colour with very high carbonation, light spicy alcohol taste, malt flavour is like a mild dark chocolate, dried fruits especially banana, light bitterness that compliments the beer nicely.
",5
5653,"this is some wicked shit very strong to the taste this looks almost ruby red and is very tart in my mind but at the same time is very smooth
",5
5654,"Red in color. Very fruity. The cork popped off and hit the ceiling. Really carbonated. Very fruity. Well balanced and pleasant. Very drinkable.
",5
5655,"reddish brown and slightly hazy	primary nose is green bell peppers w/ some sweet malt (toffee) and yeast background	med/full body and very fizzy. it erupts in your mouth. its weird how it fizzes up so much in your mouth.	im not liking this. some bubble gum, some green veg, some yeast, but they dont all come together well.
",1
5656,"Reddish brown but slightly murky. Strawberries and spice against the sweet malt background. More strawberries and some cherries on the taste. Solid structure with a tight acidity (yogurty) finish.
",1
5657,"Bottle in Brussels. Unclear brown - offwhite head. 	Raisins. Fruity. Yeasty. Dried fruits. Dark bread. Phenols. Sweetness. Light nutty. Light metallic aroma. Ok.
",5
5658,"A red abbey dubbel that is somewhat inferior compared to the other Chimay beers.
",1
5659,"Pours cloudy earthy brown with gigantic fluffy cream-colored head.  Aromas of metal, sweet spice, apple, squash bread.  Taste is medium sweet/tart, notes of clove, licorice, molasses, tart cherry, banana, and a light bitterness reminiscent of pumpernickel.  Medium body, lively carbonation, smooth texture. Complex, layered, rich, nice.
",5
5660,"A great trappist, but not the best Chimay definetely. Has an extravagant taste but yet with not a variety of flavours. The aroma is of a roasted alcochol something like a barnyard-if you know what I saying (yeah you do since you are in a beer loving site).
",1
5661,"medium head, red brown rich colour. balanced flavour, just the right amount of hopiness. smoothest trappist ive had. fairly carbinated. very mellow.
",5
5662,"Huge, froty, off-white head. Good lacing. Mostly lasting longevity. Cloudy brown body.Moderate sweet caramelic flavor. Medium palate.
",5
5663,"Nice ceiling popper. Deep orange brown with a light tan head. Fruity metallic nose. Smooth malt flavor with citrus and fruity notes throughout. Very drinkable and well balanced.
",5
5664,"I really enjoy this beer. Pours a hazy reddish color. Has very different complex flavors , has hints of yeast and apricot. Overall very good dubbel
",5
5665,"Bottle pours a hazy copper color with a nice off white head and lace sheeting.  The aroma is of yeast and apricot.  The flavor is much like the aroma and has yeast and apricot.  The palate is quite carbonated.  Overall, this is OK, but not my beer.
",5
5666,"Tried the blue, now move onto red. First thing I get is the beautiful aroma. So complex already; quite floral and fruity with a nip of alcohol on it, smells delicious. Pours thick copper with a creamy head that hangs around. The smooth silky texture of the beer brings obvious malt and fruit flavours, quite obviously apricot. Goes down with a bit of alcohol warmth and bitterness on the tongue, but nothing offensive at all. It's got quite a range of complexities to it, that I can't really put my finger on. Mainly sweet tropical fruits; like peach, apricot, bananas. More come as I get through it. It keeps you guessing, i'll try not to drink it too fast like the Blue. I'm very much liking this beer, not as much as the blue, but a more easy and different beer altogether. Cheers!
",5
5667,"Aroma after much searching I got some apricot and cloves but no banana. Murky browny red suprised it's commercial description is ""particularly attractive"". Rich sweet smooth malty flavours with the tiniest amount of alcohol afterburn. At a decent temperature it almost has a fruity/apricot sweet aftertaste with a trace of bitterness.
",5
5668,"11.2 oz. Bottle.   Tasted like every other Belgian beer with that sickening taste of yeast and bananas.  Do the Belgians only make beers with that taste?  I keep searching for an exception to the rule, but they ALL taste the same!
",1
5669,"Sweet aroma, with hints of banana and clove ... cloudy, dark amber in appearance with slowly diminishing head ... flavor has a hoppy/bitter start with a with a sudden drop into a malty finish. Overall, not the best that Chimay has to offer, but by the same token, it isn't Hamms either.
",5
5670,"Wonderful fruity aroma of apricot. Creamy head and wonderful copper color. Flavor is robust, with a silky texture and LOTS of carbonation. Semi-dry and very complex. Quite delicious
",5
5671,"Nice copper color with a full head. Spicy taste, I can feel the alcohol content in this one.
",5
5672,"not a bad beer in the scheme of things, however, it is probably the weakest of the red/white/blue chimay's. Yeasty malty flavour and mild bitterness. It lacks the full depth and complexity of the others.
",5
5673,"Very nice.  Pours a rich golden-copper, with a nice head to it.  Aroma is a little fruity, some berries, but mostly bready malt aroma.  Flavor is pretty yeasty, slightly hoppy, and ""old"" tasting.  Wish I'd tried this one sooner.
",5
5674,"Hazy, bronze color with a good head. Aroma is some licorice. Flavor is yeasty but the bitterness takes over quite quickly. Too bitter and sour.
",1
5675,"UPDATED: NOV 3, 2005 Hazy bronze color with a nice and creamy white/brownish head. Has a fruity aroma with a touch of smoke. The strong bitterness takes over the flavor quite quickly. Yeasty.
",5
5676,"A wonderful dubbel. Very smooth and full to the palate, with the mixed fruit flavor that Belgians do so well.
",5
5677,"UPDATED: JAN 31, 2005 Orangered. Cloudy. Nice thin longlasting head	Aroma of chocolate, toffee, rubber, alcohol, syrup, raisins, figs, wood and spices.	Chocolate and malt flavour. Spicy with creamy and almondy notes. A bit harsh.
",5
5678,"Pourred a copperish brew with a nice big head. The head stayed on top for a long time. Very complex spice with a not too distinct alcohol taste. I would describe the taste as sweet with a light bitterness aftertaste. Very firm body. This is classic and can never get enough of this.
",5
5679,"UPDATED: APR 14, 2004 Had a small bottle with an excellent Italian dinner in Las Vegas. What a treat. Very complex and has lots of fruit flavor, but it is not distracting. Still has a robust body. Just enough bitterness.
",5
5680,"UPDATED: JUN 12, 2004 I just can't get enough of this beer! hazy brownish colour. Big fluffy white head.  Looks very nice in the glass I got with it in the LCBO gift pack.		Sweet yeasty aroma. Perhaps banana? Super smooth flavour. It's great.
",5
5681,"Fruity hop aroma that the Belgians seem to do so well, enchanting mouthfeel little carmel sweet in the middle and seemed to get sweeter towards the end. Alcohol sneaks up on you. Glob of foam stays till the end. Not a bold enough flavor to be a beer to sit and contemplate
",5
5682,"very crisp,hints of fruit and spices,somewhat light colored but not light in taste, alot of carbonation in this bottle, but not always like that,so I hear
",5
5683,"(Bottle)  Pours a mahogany color with a medium long lasting head.  Complements a wide arange of meats, poultry, and spicy dishes.
",5
5684,"One of the best beers to cross these lips, this is an excellent standard.  Slightly fruity aroma and taste, with an extremely smooth palette.  Well balanced.
",5
5685,"Draught, 33 cL. Dark yellow colour with long lasting head. Excellent balance and variation in the flavour of malt, sweetness, yeast, bitterness and alcohol. Excellent!
",5
5686,"Mahogany body, small tan head.  Flavor is malty and fruity.  Adjuncts or not, this is a great tasting brew.
",5
5687,"Light wheat-bock aroma. Bit fruity, sweet. Light hops presence. Dark caramel-red cloudy with off-white foamy lacing head. Med body & med-heavy carb. Nice belgian taste. Sweet & malty up front with wheat-yeast fruity finish. Light hops & bitter after. Very enjoyable.
",5
5688,"Thin ever present head. Aroma of leather and straw. Smooth palate with a medium to full body. The mouthfeel is perhaps my favorite aspect of this one. Flavor of leather and straw. The finish is the only place where I taste any spicyness. Good but not my favorite of the style.
",5
5689,"Ive had this bottle of 2002 Chimay Red sitting in my closet for several months now and presently decided to show it whose boss! 	 Pours a deep mahogany body with a fizzy cream-colored head. An aroma of apples, pears, an amazing spicy presence, a nice musty note, as well as old but conditioned leather .. It really evokes memories about going to my familys old river cabin, cedar wood, the musty sweet stale air in the forest, damp compounding foliage.This brew is very earth and placid, Quit Amazing!   	 The body is medium, and finishes with a creamy spicy and dry staleness. I find it remarkable when brewers are able to create a beer with a natural earthiness without it being lackluster.... Chimay Red is certainly World Class!
",5
5690,"Wonderful murky brown beer with ruby accents..massive tan head with great staying power.	A strong aroma  of tart fruits..gooseberries, black cherries  and rasberry aromas come to mind. and great malt.	The taste even wioth all the great aromas  coming out in the mouth is quite light  good alcohol warming in the throat.	Very smooth beer.	A nice dubbel  would drink again.
",5
5691,"Malty delicious beer that looks good in the glass.  Fruit, coffee and other flavors are present.  World Class.
",5
5692,"This wasn't a bad beer.  A little fruity in the aroma, a full mouth-feel in the finish.  And the flavor was somewhat mild and yeasty.
",5
5693,"Lovely light amber in color, moderate lacing of large bubbles - aroma of apricot and other fruits, as well as some yeastiness - subtle flavors of bread, fruits, and an almost artificial sweetness - finish is dry and crisp, with just a touch of bitterness - I still don't see what all the hype about Chimay is, but this is good beer.
",5
5694,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2004 Pours with a thick head, hazy brown color.  Lots of fruity apricot taste, finishes dry.
",5
5695,"UPDATED: DEC 1, 2003 Lovely creamy head with a slight beige tint. This one's an old friend not visited in a long time and it looks simply beautiful!		The aroma's fruity, but not particularly strong, the taste somewhat harser than I had remembered. Somewhat sweet taste but also a strong hint of toasted bread? Not as rich or complex tasting as I remembered, but still a good slow sip for a relaxing evening.		Re-rate: so it's not as rich and complex as I remembered? Big deal, it's still a very pleasant brew. So it's not the most vaunted Trappist, but it goes down well and fits most occasions. Let's call it an every day Trappist and all the better for it!
",5
5696,"UPDATED: JAN 4, 2004 A thick white head on top of a deep brown ale. Both aroma and taste are fruity, yeasty, sweety, malty...This all comes to you in a complex blend. A classic.
",5
5697,"Another fine Chimay product.  Smooth bubbly palate that always reminds me of champagne.  Ages well, or so I am told ;)
",5
5698,"Red-brown colour. Velvety light-brown head. Malty and fruity aroma. Soft and smooth, malty taste. Nice.
",5
5699,"Dark red/brown with a slightly off-white head. Tasted malty, nutty with a slight bitterness. Malty and alcoholic finish. Nice, but nothing spectacular.
",5
5700,"UPDATED: JAN 31, 2004 beautiful amberish color with a thick looking density with a great fruity flavor and off white head..in 1 word - chi-marvelous
",5
5701,"This is one of the better belgium beers that I have tried. Massive off white head which diminished quickly, not a full aroma (butterscotch?), good blend of flavours too numerous to list.
",5
5702,"I guess this isn't my favorite style of beer. Different to the IPA's and Stouts and Porters I'm used to. 750mL bottle. Unfiltered deep red/mahagony pour with a lacing tan head. Fruit/floral aroma. Kind of an odd taste, I thought it was a bad bottle, but the descriptions on this site match what I taste. Strong taste, sticks to the palate. Fruit, spice, and a definite yeast presence. Strong aftertaste, too much for me. Overall not bad for the style, but I don't want to get this again.
",1
5703,"UPDATED: SEP 27, 2003 750ml bottle		Underneath a massive, fluffy, light tan head is a burgundy body with hints of amber, red, and peach. The head fills half of my goblet on the pour, and takes quite a while to shrink. Leaves decent lacing on my glass.  Aroma of sweet fruit intermingled with a strong spice note. This one has a very distinctive yeasty aroma.  Flavorful with lots of fruit and spice in an acceptable balance. A bit heavy on the yeast flavor... The finish has a really slight smokiness that I haven't ever noticed before. While it starts off nice and somewhat rich, it's aftertaste leaves something to be desired, as it's a bit thin and lacking in complexity.  Fairly thin body with a crisp, dry mouthfeel. Finishes with a tart dryness that, unfortunately, seems to highlight the subpar aftertaste. A bit watery, and not quite worthy of the reputation that having the term Trappist on the label denotes.
",1
5704,"subtle yet very appealing aroma. Very deep, dark/red amber color. Nice foamy off white head. Very light and smooth yet bold taste. Not filling at all and satisfying aftertaste.
",5
5705,"Deep red color almost like the label itself.  Cloudy and pours with a large head.  Aroma and Flavor is sweet, yeast and fruity. Mango and figs.  Slight bitterness.  Finish is mildly dry and has a lingering sweetness.
",5
5706,"UPDATED: JUL 12, 2008 Hazy, ruddy hue with an evaporating gusher head.  Toffee and candied fruits, sherried, with perfume and rosemary.  Caramel sweet, stone fruit acidity finishing in a whirl of yeasty dryness and bitter herbs.  Thin-ish with harsh carbonation and a watery texture.		Overly acidic and yeasty; really needs food for balance.		33 cl bottle, best before 2011.		75 cL bottle, goblet, 05/99 bottling, 54 degrees.  Tall, off-white, frothy head is quickly diminishing.  The body is a murky red-brown.  Mild coffee, milk chocolate, caramel, nutty malt (heavy); flowery hops (light); earth, cobweb yeast (heavy); raisin, plum, red wine, port, oak, toffee, alcohol aromas.  Moderately sweet throughout, lightly bitter, lightly acidic finish.  Flavor is lightly than the aroma led me to believe it would be.  Medium body, fizzy carbonation, watery texture with an alcohol-drying effect.  I'd really like to try a fresher bottle to see if the robustness I was expecting is present.  The bottom line is: I really like dubbels, so I was disappointed by the meek flavor in this bottle.

5707,"33 ml bottle.  Pours deep, slightly cloudy copper with a thick white head.  Aroma is fruity and spicy - cloves, nutmeg, watermelon, dried peach and yeast.  Flavor is rich, sweet and spicy, though I detected a slight metallic finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.
",5
5708,"Pours a very nice copper color with nice head. A fruity, spicy aroma. Sweet taste with nice fruit compliments. Very nice dubbel.
",5
5709,"Beautiful bronze appearance with  generous head that only lingered for awhile.  Fruit and spice in the aroma.  Lots of carbonation.  Sweet and fruity   taste, balanced with a little bitterness.
",5
5710,"Beer pours (in Chimay glass) a dark orange-red liquid light penetrates easily with a generous amount of near virgin-white head that collapses quickly, but leaves a thin film.  Aroma is of decomposing straw, grass, vegetal, citrus lemon peel, and wet sandstone.  Flavor is a spicy citrus that gives way to a very smooth and very clean palate, not dry, leaving the mouth moist.  Feels good in the mouth.  Tastes better than it smells.  Sampled at 72 degrees Fahrenheit.
",1
5711,"Burnt orange in color...sweet, flowery, malty, dry. Many tastes blend in this fine trappist beer.
",5
5712,"Red ale with plenty of floating bodies. Light shines through slightly. The head is very white but diminishing. The smell is slightly citrusy. The taste is very smooth and slightly fruity. Not as bitter as some belgians and doesn't have a long aftertaste. Heavy carbonation tickles the throat, takes away from the flavor. Very enjoyable.
",5
5713,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2004 Yeasty taste on my tongue; after tasting.. Clove? Need to try this again.
",1
5714,"Semi-murky red with rocky, diappearing head.  Apparent carbonation, smells of cherries, plums, alcohol and pepper.  Taste of largely the same.  Round-bodied, dryish finish.  Too fizzy.  But quite acceptable.
",5
5715,"Nice dark copper color with a decent head. The taste is sweet and spicy. It finishes with a fruity taste of plums or grapes?
",5
5716,"It was with great anticipation that I opened my bottle of Chimay Red. The first time I had tasted this ale, it was during a night of drinking. I was pretty much pissed at the time and I didn't expect the brick that slammed into my face when I drank my glass. I called it a slow burn then, but hey, I was drunk, so what did I know?		I was ready to taste it properly this time, and so I did.		The Chmay Red poured a deep amber with lively rising columns of carbonation. The thick, creamy head rose like a cloud above my Chimay chalice. The beer looks wonderful.		A vague fruitiness layered with a more harsh smell that, although not exact, reminded me of nutmeg. The aroma was as powerful as I expected.		This was a different time and a different day so I was ready to be objective. No slow burn this time and no grimace. The flavor is spicy. the carbonatio heightens the bite of this beer and there's no hiding the alcoholic content, it packs a punch but with great flavor.		This is a very good beer although I put it last among the three Chmays. However, that's definitely not a bad thing because all three are great.
",5
5717,"750ml bottle- cork popped to the ceiling(!), big head and a ton of fizziness, almost soda pop-ish. Color is amber-bronze and very clear. Aroma is yeasty and warm. Flavor has lots of chewy notes, but not as complex as I'd hoped. Seem to taste the cask at times as it warms and opens up.  Lots of alcohol on the tongue for a 7%ABV brew... seems higher. Will enjoy this one slowly.
",5
5718,"UPDATED: DEC 28, 2003 pleasant aroma, subtle blend of fruit, nut, and fresh bread. fizzy, straw colored pour. lively nearly all white head that twinkles and it is a bit airy, but it doesn't turn me off. murky brick red, orange body. marvelous flavor - same as aroma, but it striking my tongue is much more rewarding. soft, slightly bitter - an excellent brew.
",5
5719,"750ml bottle- Color is a solid caramel brown with a peachy reddish tone, nice inch high head of tight bubbly off-white creamy foam, faded slowly to a skim always present and large drippy lacing.		Smell is one complex mother of a dubble, quite unique, good smokeyness comes through with bacon and smoked dried oranges, sweet smokey malts, other dark but dullish fruit of plum and raisin, candied toffee notes and what I'm guessing is alot of wild yeast and a bit of cherry as well. Hard to get past the smokey sense, but it tames as it sits longer.		Taste is smooth and creamy delight of complexity, let this sit awhile after pouring, it seemed to ripen on the vine as it warmed a bit. Finally as I begin to reward my taste buds it starts with a touch of mint up front leading right into a punch of sweet malts, dulled oranges and dark fruits, mostly plum, a subtle touch of raisin, cherry, and toffee. The smokey sense from the smell is all but null and void. I was hoping it would maybe show up somewhere as it warmed, but nope. Towards the end it pick up some banana esters and good amounts of milding spice, clove, and yeast keeping this very smooth and quite full, a bit of a tingly-fluffy carbonation shows up late towards the finish.		Complexfully wonderful and a great sipper. Excellent yeasty surprise; smooth, creamy, tingly, spicey, fruity, nearly everything a good Belgian needs this has.
",5
5720,"Not as good as Chimay Bleu, but the Rouge version is also a wonderful abbey ale.  Beautiful to smell and taste, the big bottle is great for sharing.
",5
5721,"UPDATED: JAN 17, 2008 Excellent ale. Beautiful and aromatic. Smooth and silky on the tongue with a pleasant alcohol warmth. Seems to me that you can sense the cask a bit in the aftertaste, which adds something. Absolutely wonderful. A favorite.
",5
5722,"After hearing all of the lore and hype concerning Chimay, I tried this one. Yes, it is a very good beer, with good color, flavor, and nose, but it wasn't the best trappist ale I've had (the flavor wasn't ""rich"" enough for me, and a tad too floral).
",5
5723,"Damn Good                                                                    Yeah!
",5
5724,"As I remember it was my first Trappiste. Ruby brown color and brown medium head. Very aromatic: cherries, yeast, raisins. The taste was a bit ordinary, but fruitiness and bitterness interplayed beautifully. A Trappiste for beginners.
",5
5725,"I have to stop rating tonite, this beer tastes just like the one I just had. Did I even rinse my glass? Seriously, I think the more yeasty beers don't sit that well with me. Combine that with complex maltiness and it's a difficult quaff.
",1
5726,"UPDATED: MAR 27, 2008 Copper color with a medium head.  Light aroma of malt and yeast.  Very weak spice notes in the taste.  Moderate alcohol presence.  The malt flavor is almost hidden.
",5
5727,"UPDATED: FEB 19, 2004  On draught at Belgian Beer Caf ""Belle Vue"", Kiev, Ukraine.  Hazy mahogany color. Unbelieavably ozon-like nostrils-filling aroma. Malty toffeish flavor. Fizzy, bubbly palate. Medium bitterness.
",5
5728,"Cloudy, nutbrown body.	Fresh aroma, ozon-ish.	Wellbalanced, but a bit thin with too little flavour.
",1
5729,"I was slightly disappointed in this.  The head poured nicely, but not much in the way of ""complexity"" in aroma. Slightly fruity aroma with some hoppiness pepper in the nose.  Bubbly and fizzy on the tongue, but taste was somewhat average.  Malty, carmel with some heffe-like spices mixed in, but very faint.  I was expexting to be ""wowed"" with all the hype, but it's just ""very good"".  I drove 22 miles to find it, but I won't go to that trouble again.
",5
5730,"UPDATED: AUG 5, 2003 Monstrous foamy Chimay head that diminished well but left behind a thick cottony lacing. Sweet floral and yeasty fragrance. Also aromas of stone fruit, bubble gum, and cotton candy. Flavors of citrus and candy-sugar. Alcohol is noticeable. Lively champagne-like mouthfeel but medium-bodied and silky smooth. Very nice.
",5
5731,"Very dark in the coloring, like a barleywine, in the look and aroma.  Smells of fruit, raisins, bananas, pears and cloves.  Very complex and slightly acidic, bittersweet with a roasted nutty malty caramel like aftertaste.  Very full and satisfying.
",5
5732,"UPDATED: MAY 21, 2005 Brown and ruby colour with some haze. Big creamy head. Sweet aroma of honey with some pepper and alcohol. Tatse: very fruity and yeasty; dried apricot, tropical fruit and lemon. Herbs and peppery alcohol keeps it balanced. Also some chocolate in background.
",5
5733,"Deep mahogany color, average head and lacing. Citrus aroma with a background of floral hops, licorice, banana, clove, bubble gum. Very complex flavor, very active carbonation but a smooth caramel finish. Bitterness in the end is present and a creamy mouthfeel. A very complex and satisfying belgian beer.
",5
5734,"UPDATED: MAY 22, 2005 Im really not sure how I feel about rating it for I will tie Emily (ChimayBabe) in overall ratings and do it while drinking Chimay Red. I know she would understand. Now the day I equal Aaron, Jeff, or Eric will be cause for celebration. This is one of the beers that created the beergeek I am today, 15 years later and it is still one of my first loves and something I drink 3 or 4 times a year. Anyway, on to the rate: Copper hue with lasting head and excellent lacing. Fruity aroma with hints of cassis, apples, straw, oak, and nutty malt. Nice crisp fruity taste with equal balance of bitterness and sweetness, finish somewhat dry and clean. Very lively yet full-bodied mouthfeel. Wonderful! Its complex yet smooth, this is a world-class dubbel and my favorite of the Chimay line. Very highly recommended.
",5
5735,"Good stuff.  Coppery color, with a large head.  It had a subtle light fruity taste that flowed like silk while being quaffed.
",5
5736,"Sorry thedm, but I call them the way I smell them!! If my remark influenced your decision, I apologize. This is rating #300 for me!! This beer poured a medium tan head with fine sized bubbles. Yes, the nose did remind me of vomit. The body was murky and there was carbonation observed. The hue was that of cider and the lacing was sparse on the sides of my glass. The flavor was spicy and the mouthfeel was smooth and tingly on my tongue.
",5
5737,"haha The beer head started foaming up out of the bottle before I even started pouring it.  It had a white head of finely sized white bubbles coming out of the bottle!  After I poured it into my bug, it formed a large invigorated head of finely sized white bubbles that lasted a good length of thime.  Its body was a cloudy yeasty brown color and its aroma was that of a very mild, dare I say hotstuff influencenced me, vomit.  Thanks Hotstuff for the thought.  Fortunately the flavor was a bit better.  The flavor contains notes of alcohol, spices, caramel malt and molasses.  The mouthfeel is tingly and smooth.  If only it smelled better!
",5
5738,"UPDATED: OCT 26, 2003 Nearly perfect in every way except for the price. I really did like it, what a great smokey yet slightly sweet flavor. Made by Monks so I can say that I pray I can find it cheeper. Terrific though a bit more bitter than my other faves.
",5
5739,"11oz. bottle. Large off white head. Murky brown color. Fruity, (banannas, apples)and somewhat sulfury nose. Medium body. Nice mouthfeel, carbonation level is perfect. Fruity flavored, apples and some raisiny notes lead to a dry spicey finish, Nice 7%er
",5
5740,"Poured with copper body and slight head.  Flavor was sweet and malty, like maple syrup and fruit.  No bitterness.  Some hops could really help this beer out.  Good, but not something I would drink regularly.
",5
5741,"There are beers that are made to take when you are thirsty or to cool your throat in a hot day. This is much more than this. It is an experience. It has a strong and a little bit fruity taste that fills completely your senses. Is a beer that you have to drink slowly and enjoy.
",5
5742,"UPDATED: AUG 12, 2003 Pours a wonderful evil copper color. A great white head that refuses to die and a nice amount of lace. The taste hits your tounge in a beautiful wave of complexity that doesn't quite rival the bleu but is unique and very savory. I love this beer.
",5
5743,"Bottle at Austins Steakhouse. Pours a cloudy copper with medium off-white head. Aroma is predominantly raisin, yeast, and caramel. Theres a background of pepper and fruity esters. Flavor has a sweet malt backbone with a wonderful mix of spice and yeast. Some sharp hops bring out the bitterness but are softened by a raisin-caramel finish. This was great with my perfectly seared blue cheese burger.
",5
5744,"33 cl bottle. Pours hazy mahogany coloured beer. Beige head. Aroma: Fruity, cellar, Sisu pastilles. Taste: Moderate sweetness, some bitterness. Palate: Medium body, average carbonation.
",5
5745,"poured into my chimay glass. didnt realize its a bottle fermented beer. aroma is fruity. flavour is fruity also, but I detect no dryness. overall an ok beer.
",5
5746,"Dark brown, light, big bubble head that sticks well. Medium-dark reddish brown. Tons of spice in the aroma, along with a good dose of Trappist funk. Effervescence is high, but doesnt bite too hard--actually quite soft. Good dryness to it. A bit of metal and fruit rind in the flavor. Paired with Chiimay cheese: soft (in between Jack and brie), very bitter, and has a ton of charcoal/burnt meat flavor.
",5
5747,"Yeasty doughy Dubbel. Not much of a head. Although I liked it I will stick to the blue.
",1
5748,"330ml bottle. Pours a cloudy a hazy copper/amber (fresh bottle so guess the yeast didnt have time to settle to the bottom) with a finger of head that quickly disappears leaving almost no lacing. Aroma is overwhelmingly belgian yeast and delicious, reminding me of dough rising. Smooth, light and bubbly in the mouth with a floral and hoppy hints mixed in with the big bold yeast and sweat taste.
",5
5749,"ok beer I prefer beers with less  sugar, now I tasted the Caulier, I cant stop!!
",1
5750,"Chimay is a quality brand and beer. But I have to say that this beer is my least favorite of the Chimay family. Still very high quality beer. Just a little more bitter than the Blue and Cinq white
",5
5751,"UPDATED: OCT 23, 2003 From a 330 ml bottle. Commercial description has it about right, color is appealing brown, the head itself taste pretty good. Overall the beer is pretty sweet, caramelic and pleasant with an enjoyable bitterness that pops in right on time. Complex and easy to drink for a trappist. Pure quality.
",5
5752,"UPDATED: JUL 28, 2007 July 2007. Hazy brown body with a moderate beige head (3+). Sweet aroma of malt, caramel,  and lightly scorched toffee, hints of brown sugar, and wisps of yeast and alcohol. (7+) Sweet caramel malt flavour is relatively simply with dry alcoholic undercurrent that lingers long in the aftertaste. Tangy malt bite in the finish (7+). Smooth but light medium palate (3+).  7+/3+/7+/3+/14-16 - 3.7	<P>Dec 2000. The first of the gift set... Nice foamy head. Taste the spices more as it warms. Hint of fruit, goes down deceptively easy. 7/4/7/15 - 3.7
",5
5753,"Very fruity. But also very good. Another good one from Chimay. Not quite as good as the Bleu, but good nonetheless.
",5
5754,"Copper/Red color. Substantial head. Fruity and medium bodied and flavored. Slight bitter finish.
",5
5755,"Medium brownish-red color, lots of carbonation, but head fizzled out quickly with no lace. Smells of ALCOHOL and nuts. Malty and nutty, and even at just 7% ABV, there was obviously no attempt to hide the alcohol, which after a while, became overwhelming. Watery palate and too flat for me.
",1
5756,"Head dissipates.  Cloudy, which is not how I like my beer.  Apple cider.  Smells good from far away.  Smells really good, actually.  Beery but citrusy.  Not bad.  Taste is not bad exacly.  There's not much at first but after it sinks in it goes ""BLACH!""  Average nouthfeel.
",1
5757,"Very full voluminous lasting head with tiny nitrous like bubbles that give this beer a sparkling mouthfeel.  The color is like an old penny... beautiful.  The aroma is a little subtle but fruity malt and a little yeast...  Flaor is mild for it's style but pleasing.  I like the rusty taste in the head.  Apples and berrys... with a bitter finish.  Very nice to my mouth.
",5
5758,"These monks make the most of the one vice allowed.  A beer with complex wine-like qualities.  Hints of various fruits come through as it warms.  Try it with Havarti or another soft cheese.  Outstanding beer.
",5
5759,"a thick head with good carbonation.  a slightly bitter aftertaste, but still very pleasant.
",5
5760,"Big frothy head.  Fruity aroma.  good carbanation.  Very yeasty with fruit flavors.  Very clean on the palate.  good beer but it's pricey.  I won't spend the money again.
",5
5761,"UPDATED: DEC 1, 2003 Re-rate.  This is much better than I remember it being.  Aroma is spicy/yeasty, not increibly complex, but attractive.  Appearance is nice light brown with off white head that is retained.  Flavor is quite nice also, full flavor exhibiting an awesome yeast strain, mild notes of dried fruit, some maltiness, and a dry bitter finish.  Very good and I repent of my prior rants against Chimay.
",5
5762,"Brownish amber color, head didn't last but thousands of tiny bubbles kept forming on the top making it look like it was still fermenting. Some sediment on the bottom of the bottle. Pleasant aroma of molasses with touch of soy. Delicious malty flavor that reminds me of baked apples or apple crisp. Finish is sweet, smooth and faintly hoppy. Different and intriguing, but still I'm sitting here wondering what all the fuss is about. But like I say, it's intriguing.
",5
5763,"Wow.  Tons of carbonation which produce a nice head but then whisks it away rather quickly.  Nice aroma of yeast and some fruit (cherry).  Very good color of deep orange/copper.  Carbonation is a little bit much and distracts from the flavor of the beer.  As soon as you put the beer into your mouth it explodes into a bubbly concoction.  Perhaps this will get better as the beer warms.  Flavor is a bit sour and bitter with apricot, malt and yeast.  The finish is a little bitter with a plesant alcohol warming.  A good quality beer but there are better trappists out there.
",5
5764,"UPDATED: JAN 23, 2007 Date on cork - 05/02; Best before - 2006; Deep copper colour lots of tan, rocky head. Yeast, plum, apple, and berry aroma. Plum and raisin flavours, with yeast and an underlying spicy but mellow bitterness. Creamy, smooth, and full bodied.
",5
5765,"UPDATED: NOV 18, 2003 Orange-brown color, malty and yeasty aroma (clove and alcohol notes). Taste is moderatly sweet, nutty and a little bit bitter, some acid. Aftertaste is alcoholic and a hint watery.
",5
5766,"UPDATED: NOV 5, 2004 Looking at this beer in my glass reminds me of the Charles River in Boston. From the swampy color to the tan foamy head. Aroma is complex, fruity, malty with a slight floral presence. Crisp and effercescent, yet smooth and medium to full bodied with an ever so slight metallic finish. Very drinkable especially at 55+ degrees. Good sample of a good Belgian Abbey Dubbel.
",5
5767,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2009 Bottle.	Reddish-orange color. With amber and copper tinges.  Smells like plum and alcohol.  Initial taste has cherry flavored notes which are highly pleasant.  Alcohol begins to come out immediately and does not overpower.  Body is medium and there is a round flavor on the palate throughout.  It warms very very nicely and many more plum, cherry and other fruit notes are apparent.  Ends with a nice yeasty alcohol taste, that leaves a bit more to be desired body wise (I finished mine very quickly) but other than this, no complaints.  Rerate, blind dubbel tasting.  I sure dont remember this one being this full and flavorful, but wow. My friend and I both picked this one as our favorite (and best of style) hands down.  Ripe red fruits, soft cherry cola, medium dark malts, bubbly palate and a wonderful yeastiness.  The fruit was fabulous though and really put this one on top.  Great stuff and its nice to revisit a chimay and find it better than remembered.
",5
5768,"This beer pours a cloudy brown with hints of red around the edges.  It has a minimal head and minimal lacing - a very attractive looking beer.  The aroma is filled with fruits and malts.  The flavor is very enjoyable.  It has a lot of fruity flavors and it is fairly sweet and full bodied.  The alcohol is vaguely apparent, but just to the point that it adds character to the flavor.  I would highly recommend this beer as well as the other Chimay products.
",5
5769,"Bottled. Amber with a good dash or red. Cherry and plum aroma, fruity sweetness. Lovely full texture on the palate, sort of scraps the outsides of your tongue on the way down. Not overly sweet which is a good thing.
",5
5770,"very plummy, malty and round flavoured, which makes you expect a fatter and fuller body than you actually get. but i dont mind the lightness. a bit on the bland and sweet side, but there's nothing harsh or wrong with it - one for drinkin not thinkin.
",5
5771,"Aroma is slightly sour, musty with a hint of hops and sweet malt. Appearance is brownish-red in the glass with cloudy consistency and pure white head. Flavour is malty, sweet with slight bitter finish.  Slight metallic taste.
",5
5772,"Dark brown with reddish shine. Medium-thick, slightly coloured head, collapsing. Very strange meaty smell, like gelatine in a meatpastry, and arachide (peanut)oil or -butter. Metallic nose too, and after some time, dark malts and just a hint of hops. Very little bit metallic taste, then roasted malts, spicey - don't dare to say hops - and, definitely, salts. There is some salty whiff in this brew. Retronasal again meaty - and fruity notes, or preserved fruit. Rather light-bodied, certainly for its 7% ABV. Something velvety, however, on the tongue. The wheat 'flour' showing? I cannot follow people who praise this to heaven, nor those who will see nothing but a commercially denaturated product in this beer. An above average, reasonnable beer.
",5
5773,"I had this at a beer and food night and this one was the 'light' beer. It is lightly hopped with a hint of banana. The head in my glass was small with fair lacing. I thought the body could have been more robust and found the palate a bit too lively.
",5
5774,"Nice and solid dubbel. Hard to add anyhting that the commercial description misses. A nice mixed fruit aroma. A ever so slight step down from the blue (if I remember correctly). Still a top notch effort.
",5
5775,"Nice head, some bubble gum and spice can be detected in the aroma. Not as full flavored as its brothers and the body seems a bit lacking, thinner somehow. Finishes like tea, bittering and coating the tounge with a chalky residue. Not my favorite Chimay.
",1
5776,"UPDATED: AUG 16, 2003 A dark honey color with a large frothy off white head. A small amount of sediment floating. Aroma is malty and sweet with hints of fruit. Lively carbonation. A smooth lightly bitter finish
",5
5777,"I wouldn't call it red, but a cloudy orangeish-redish color.  Good head that quickly dissapaited.  Aroma is interesting, and I had a hard time pin-pointing what it was, maybe some spices, and some vanilla.  Flavor was complex and balanced.  Good all the way though.
",5
5778,"Another high-class Abbey Dubbel beer. A beautifully creamy head and brownish body. Ummm
",5
5779,"UPDATED: NOV 24, 2003 Hazy amber-brown color, thick foamy head that eventually settles down. Yeasty aroma, lightly spiced taste. I expected a little more out of this, but it was still quite good.
",5
5780,"Thick in the head, it eventually sinks down into a thin layer of rich whipped cream on top of a glowing dark amber pool. The aroma is difficult to find, just a hint of earthy vanilla. This beer has a very finely balanced roller coaster ride of spiceyness and sweetness that strikes you in waves.  Big bitey nutmeg and cinnamon in the beginning, sweet doughy bread in the the middle, and a subdued acidic finish with a touch of hop bitternesss. Well executed, well balanced, well done. Be well.
",5
5781,"Pours a dark rusty brown with a voluptuous creamy head.  Sweet caramel, bready, Belgian yeast aroma.  Body has light carbonation, good malt balance, and a dry woody profile.  Palate is silk spinkled with candi sugar.  This beer is done well.
",5
5782,"Sweet aroma.Head is thick with lacing all down the side of the glass.Flavors of plum,bannana and caramel are noticed. Nice yeasty finish. Another good chimay.
",5
5783,"Aromatic sweetness, hops, and a whif of pine. Pours a very dark brown, cloudy, lacing is quite nice. Mouthfeel is enjoyable, complex and robust. A balanced beer; alcohol is well hidden, fruity flavours come through, hops are present but not overpowering. A quality beer. Love that stubby inspired bottle.
",5
5784,"This was amber/red with a small head.  It was a medium body, malty, lightly hopped.  This was a nice dessert beer.
",5
5785,"Aromatic spicy nose  with a hint of plum, sugar and caramel.  In a glass the ale was  a rich ruby brown color. The head was thick and light beige and left lacing all down the side. The taste was richly malty and fruity with a touch of sweetness. The relatively high alcohol content ( 7%) was well hidden. Over all a delicious ale.
",5
5786,"Surprisingly quickly diminishing head for what I consider to be a premium quality (or at least price) dubbel. A mix of large and small bubbles which is indicative of low quality (with apologies to Trappist Ales Rule). Mild aroma with some slight estery yeast notes. Hazy reddish brown. Very sweet. Some candi sugar, bananas, and maybe some plumb. A sharp bite from the carbonation. Definitely a solid Belgian though not the best. Not as complex as I like to see in a dubbel but, in my opinion, superior to the Bleu.
",5
5787,"rather new to belgium styles... not a bad beer but definitely something i would buy too much of
",1
5788,"Nice fruity overtones as I got deeper into my glass.  Balanced is the best word to describe it.  It gets better as it warms up...nothing about it really catches my attention.  Maybe a little too middle of the road.  Worth having anytime though.
",5
5789,"Very nice color and smells so sweet.  Very nice blance taste.  I have found the Chimay bleu to be my favorite.
",5
5790,"garnet in color with nice sticky head. aroma of  spices and dark fruits, taste of plums with some peppery spices, and caramel malt. smooth and easy drinking, nice
",5
5791,"Deep ruby hue.  Big fruity nose of plums, bananas, chocolate.  Beige sticky head with nice lacing.  Sweet malts, raisons, yeast, spices, medium bodied, gentle carbonation.  Let this warm please.  Very smooth and well balanced.  A classic no doubt.
",5
5792,"High carbonation.  Too much for my taste.  Big malt flavor with noticable hop notes trying to balance it.  Definate finishing yeast presence.  Better than Chimay's Cinq Cents in my book.
",5
5793,"Perhaps I drank it to young? It has some faint notes of fruit in the aroma, but not enough. A bit sweet i flavor.
",1
5794,"Light chocolate brown w/ tan head. Fruit, caramel, & spice on the nose. Perhaps a little thin for style. Flavour nice but not overly complex: caramel, brown sugar, some fruit, yeast, & alcohol. Had this along side the Bleu. No doubt it's a decent beer but it pales in comparison.
",5
5795,"From the small bottle: Browinsh orange with a finely carbonated sturdy head. Has the familiar musty smell, and note of fruit, smoke, dirt (in a good way)and a drier finish. If you dump the yeast in you get a peppery flavor as well.
",1
5796,"This is a pretty good example of an Abbey Dubble, I still prefer others, but the complexity of this brew keeps drawing me back.
",5
5797,"This one pours a ruddy bronze color with a deep haze, ample white head and considerable lace. The main thrust of the head dissipates quickly leavy a wispy white covering.		There is a sweetness to the nose, which is nevertheless faint and also redolent of ripe fruit and complex spiciness.		Mouthfeel is fulll, creamy and carbonated. Strong malts attack the taste buds and fill the palate, and then quickly balanced by a mixture of hops, and a yeasty presence of fruity complexity.		A classic Trappist, popular for all the right reasons.
",5
5798,"good malty notes with a sweet aftertaste. It had mildly hoppy with a great color.  The smell was fruity, yet light.
",5
5799,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2004 havent had this for some time. It was my favorite some years ago, before I ever tasted the other Chimays. Its not the best Chimay but it is a very very good beer. Very rich aroma, taste is a bit bitter, very malty and slightly fruity.. good stuff!	re-rate. After one year of no Chimay Rouge I decided to have on.. and let me say, I was hugely dissapointed, somewhat in my memery this was a very nice brew, but now I see nothing special about it, it looks good, the aroma is slightly sour and a bit complex. The taste has that same sour stuff as in the aroma, I dont know how to explain it, but I dont like it (re-re-rate) the bottles now are quite good, that awful sour taste I found last time is gone and this is quite the nice dubbel
",5
5800,"This is quite good! I like the yeasty aroma with dark fruit overtones. Appearance is beautiful, cloudy burnt amber with a nice off-white matching head. Slightly bitter, nice sensation on the tongue. I like this ale very much. I like all the Chimay's very much!
",5
5801,"yeasty/wheaty nose, dark brwon cloudy hue with a large off-white head, malty and yeasty, there are orange and toffee notes, luxuriuosly thick palate, nice malt aftertaste.
",5
5802,"I couldn't believe the head on this . . .poured it in a 14 oz. goblet and it maintained a 2-3 in froth for the duration of the drink.  Tasty, but not that much better than New Belgium's abbey offering.  I agree with Gusler though, that every drinker should try thisor their Blue at least once.  Cheers!
",5
5803,"Lietchies nose, a bit sulphury. Rocky fizzy head on a red orange brew with fizzy carbonation. Pricks and numbs the tongue, spicey  and fruity - grapes and pepper. Very fizzy but very nice.
",5
5804,"Rich yeasty aroma.  Deep red colour with large foamy head.  Great malty taste with mild yeasty flavours.  Fantastic beer with a great complexity and hints of orange and pear.  Great stuff!
",5
5805,"Mild yeasty aroma.Smooth medium hoppy yeasty flavor with a touch of banana.Clean finish.Lacks the character the other Trappist, and many, abbey dubbels have.
",5
5806,"this was my first experience with the chimays and i was more than pleasantly surprised. served in a goblet showcasing a nice fluffy cream head, the beer was a clear deep yellow. lots of aroma with a bit of a floral scent. mostly malt with a citrus finish. very fine beer.
",5
5807,"33 CL Bottle.  One of the first times I've had the small bottle of this one.  While I enjoyed this one, the bigger bottle does tend to have more complexity.  This one was a bright deep copper color with a moderate off white head. Malty aroma with a touch of fruit and floral hops.  In the small bottle very clean and more refined.
",5
5808,"a nice light belgian taste.  Not nearly as harsh as most of the belgains that i've had.
",5
5809,"UPDATED: FEB 14, 2004 Murky brown color with a medium head. Fruit filled aroma. A malty flavor with some dark fruit, caramel, and chocolate. I would almost call this one Chimay Blue light. A nice Dubbel and this is quickly becoming one of my favorite styles.
",5
5810,"Good crisp taste with a fruitness closely matching bananas.  Nice amount of carbonation and froth makes me think this would be an excellent beer for a hot summer night.  Also, crazy alcoholic.
",1
5811,"Got a bottle of this as a gift today, I usually skip right over the Red and the White for the Blue.  Poured a nice deep red color, head is initially quite strong but it shrinks quickly.    Yeasty spicy flavor.
",5
5812,"Despite having tried this beer in the past, I hadn't rated it, which means I hadn't had it in the 13+ months I'd been here.  So I picked up a bottle, half expecting that my ""matured"" palate would end up treating this as an also-ran, perhaps an ""accessible"" Trappist beer.  Accessible it may be, but even still, it's a damn fine beer!  The body is a beautiful hazy chestnut, topped by a small tan head.  The aroma is Belgian yeasty, medium sweet, malty, with just a slight hint of spice.  Tastewise, it's mildly sweet, yeasty, malty, and lightly spiced.  Very well-balanced.  It's got a big body -- definitely for sipping, not for gulping.  Even still, the mouthfeel is light, no doubt owing to the flood of carbonated bubbles that touch your tongue on contact.
",5
5813,"What's not to like about this.  The aroma is outstanding, the appearance is great.  The flavor and texture are so smooth, that its hard not to like.
",5
5814,"Hmmmm...could we have found a new favorite?  Possibly.  This Trappist Dubbel is delicious!  The fact that it is unfiltered and unpasteurized is evident the minute you start to pour.  Trying to stare through this brew's murky depths is like staring through a pond after the silt has been stirred up.  The head is heavy and thick, and it lingers for quite some time.  The flavor is fruity with just enough malt and hops.  Finish is slightly citrus with a touch of alcohol, as one would expect from this potent 7% potable.  All in all, I must say the monks have done it again...WORLD CLASS!
",5
5815,"09/01 premiere bottle: Pours deep amber-brown with almost cloudy look to it. Huge foaming tight beige head, half of it dissapeared rather quickly though, decent retention of the rest. Dark fruit aroma with a hint of smoke/roasted grains to it. Complex taste, very fruity and sweet but beautifully balanced. Hints of spice/clove to it as well. Lovely smooth full mouthfeel. Hint of alcohol as you get further into it, Top drop.
",5
5816,"09/02 date on cork, sampled 03/03.  High pressure in the bottle when opened at cellar temp.  PPoured with huge head, to be expected with the apparent carbonation.  Nice reddish brown color with iny fine bubble rising.  Aroma is dry and malty with a light nuttyness.  Flavor is hard to pin down, not overbearing, it is warm and malty / nutty.  Nice fuzzyness on the tounge with a little bit of hops in the finish.  I had this once about 6 months ago and it find it better than I remember.
",5
5817,"I like this beer very much, a little bit more fruit than the blue. Great body and a very nice head and colour.	Very harmoniously in sweet- and bitterness.
",5
5818,"fruity nose. What a great aroma. great color. wonderful sweet start with a slight astringent/alchohol finish. strong brew that was a pleasure to drink.
",5
5819,"What a way to start an education in beer.  I spent two years in Belgium as an Army brat and thought this would be a nice reunion.  It was very smooth going down, slightly bitter, and had a nice aroma.  Compared to similar beers, it was very strong in flavor.
",5
5820,"This Chimay poured with a mahagony body and a 2 finger white frothy head. Lots of bubbles and a great tingly carbonation. The palate is so very smooth and fills my mouth nicely. The aroma is floral with a bit of apricot. A nice spicy flavor, alcohol in the aftertaste that warms my stomach. Maybe some cloves. The head lasts the whole glass and is clinging to the side.
",5
5821,"Just starting to learn to appreciate good beer.  I never understood what people meant by fruity..ect.  After trying my first Chimay Red, I do.  I really enjoyed this and can't wait to try the blue and the white.
",5
5822,"this is what i would expect a monk beer to look like: murky and filthy with bits of yeast swimming around. i love it. not as dry as the Blanche but a bit smoother. the taste is a bit fruity.
",5
5823,"Like the blue this is also a great beer only lighter in aftertaste and more bitter in general.
",5
5824,"Quite different compared to my last tasting of chimay, definatly has a stronger larger bitter flavour but yet still a sweetness which is customary for chimay. The aftertaste is mellower than i expected after the first sip, a great all round beer is definatly worthy of wearing the trappist name.
",5
5825,"UPDATED: FEB 18, 2003 This is the ale that all others should be measured against. Absolutely perfect balance of spices, malts and creaminess. Great mellow attack, full soft complex middle, with some tones of bitterness, and spices. Fruitiness around the middle palate and then a burst of bitters and creamy ending. 	This is perfection in a bottle, and cellar bottles for future consumption. They get mellower and longer with age. What a prize.
",5
5826,"UPDATED: NOV 21, 2011 Feb, 2003 Soft as duck down and twice as tasty. The alcohol monster sneaks up on crepe soled shoes to slap you around the head after a while - but by then you dont really care. The clove has lulled and numbed and whispered and you have either succumbed or complained. A strange and interesting brew. Take off your armour and let it seduce with its perfume. A warm and attractive beer that suffers from expectation. It aint the worlds best, but it is damn good. [3.4]	Nov, 2005 Yeasty fudge, varnish, paint and raw mushroom aroma with some burnt sugar and alcohol. Mostly chalky dry (yet sweet) with muddy spices, chocolate liquor,  some clove, a pleasant sudden sharp fruit just before the swallow, and lingering alcohol on the way down. Very late tobacco and toffee notes. Doesnt quite hold together. Light (almost thin) bodied, initially alcoholic and odd tasting, though with conditioning/aging the alcohol will mellow into a pleasant sweetness. [2.9]	May, 2006 Blind tasting:  Belgian aroma. Some chocolate. A touch of coffee. Yeasty. Bottle conditioned. Strong - 9%? Pleasant. Sweet, yet well attenuated / dry. [2.9]	May, 2011 This is a drinkable beer. It has pleasant parts, but doesnt exceed itself in any area. Hops are bittering rather than aromatic, and dont provide much interest other than a counterbalance to the sweetness. Palate is dry - chalky at times. Flavours are pleasant rather than exciting, interesting, special or unusual. Some yeasty notes. It is what it is, and its OK. [3.0] 	Nov, 2011 Part of the Nice Carrefour Belgian pack during the Nice-Cannes marathon week. I opened the bottle and allowed some of the carbonation to burn off during the night, but that still hasnt dramtically improved this beer. This is not really my cup of tea - the more I have it over the years the more I realise I dont really like it. Despite all the acclaim and interest, I dont think this a genuinely good quality beer. The ingredients are not top quality, and the beer, despite the evocative monestary connection, is made in a modern steel conical which reduces character. This might have been a great beer many years ago, before Chimay changed their production method, but today its a poor mix of poor quality ingredients including wheat starch, sugar and hop extract. I keep wanting to love it because of its history, but lets be honest here, this is a bad beer. [2.5]
",1
5827,"The whiter-fruit Chimay in my opinion.  Green grapes, banana, vanilla is more discernable than the darker plum and raisin of the Chimay White.
",5
5828,"Pours a beautiful dark copperish color. Aroma is of fruit and hops. Tastes like fruit and spices. The flavor is fairly complex but nothing like Bleu. This is a very good beer.
",5
5829,"I was surprised at how enjoyable this beer is.  The Bleu is more complex, and quite possibly a more interesting beer to study.  I had this with a salad at the end of a very long day and found it delightful.  Nose is a classic European hop, floral and bitter, and some malt.  Appearance is cloudy, reddish copper, small head, white lace.  Taste is fruit, spice (banana and clove?  they say apricot, but I just did not get apricot!), and classic European hoppiness.  Good big mouthfeel.  Nice, solid, bitter finish.  Delightful.  I was surprised that I liked this more than the more famous and more highly regarded Bleu and Blanche.
",5
5830,"You still cannot go wrong with the name Chimay. This one, as most Chimay's are, was a gusher from the get-go. Orangey amber color with massive and i mean massive just off white tannish head which had subsided about halfway through the enjoyment. The aroma is beaming with orange and nectarie and well as some spicey clean qualities. The taste begins with a definite fruity undertone. Grapefruit, orange and nectarine dance through my head. The ending finishes very bitterly and very dry..probably about my only markdown...a bit too much of a bittering of the palate. Overall a beautiful looking and smelling beer (as always with Chimay), but an overwhelming bitterness quelches a nice fruit and malt laden beer.
",5
5831,"Pours reddish brown with a lively, bubbly head that sticks around.  Aroma is complex, funky and fruity.  Taste just does not live up to the aroma or the appearance.  The flavors are very subtle, and basically kind of boring.  There is some dark fruit, and some bitterness along with sweet malts... but nothing jumps out and grabs you.  This is my least favorite of the Chimay brews, and I only drink it if its given to me.  In fact, this is the worst trappist beer I have tried.
",1
5832,"UPDATED: OCT 27, 2011 	I have had this one before, but not recently, Il review it. Best Before End: 2014.		It pours a reddish brown with a quickly dissipating white head.		The smell is unmistakable. It smells almost like a framboise. It has raspberries and dark fruit amidst caramally dark candi sugar malts.		The flavor follows. Lots of sweet caramel and alcohol, ripe dark fruits, some earthiness. It is a good dubbel.
",5
5833,"Bottle at Remedy Cafe in Edmonton.	Pours a rich bright brown, with a light fluffy head. Spices in the nose, usual to belgian ales, but there is a rich sweetness that is not generally found in trippels or strong ales. Taste is a meld of light and dark fruits with spices, such as cloves. Mouthfeel is medium with a nice carbonation - all of which suits the flavours well. Finish is very smooth, not bitter or acidic. Quite a nice beer, dont know if this style is my favorite, but this beer pulls it off well.
",5
5834,"Amazing, Druglike enjoyment, pleasant copper colour, nice maltiness, low bitterness, good balance.
",5
5835,"A wonderful dubbel. The pour is cloudy mahogany with hints of ruby red. The aroma is rich and yeasty with huge malts. Sweet and slightly bitter taste with tons of esters of apricot and raisin. I love the smoothness of the beer with almost no carbonation. Beautiful silky mouthfeel
",5
5836,"Copper/amber pour with white head and lace. Aroma is caramel malt and brown sugar. Brown sugar, bread, and light abv. A bit thin and fizzy for me but a very nice beer.
",5
5837,"a little overrated if you ask me. but still pretty good. malts, yeast and some caramel and fruit dominate the flavour. the colour was awesome, dark red. otherwise decent
",1
5838,"UPDATED: NOV 6, 2011 I fear my bottle may be skunked. It totally volcanoed out of the bottle when I cracked it open and it smells like apple juice. Nonetheless it tastes pretty good, if not amazing.
",5
5839,"UPDATED: AUG 9, 2003 What's great about this beer?  Well, it's always available and might make for a decent convert beer for those who haven't tried Belgians.  Other than that?  While good, I honestly don't understand all the fuss about this dubbel.  Color is alright, but not a standout among the style.  Aroma is nice, but a little lacking, in my opinion.  And flavor...well it lacks a whole lot of character, which I find in the style from Westmalle and Corsendonk.  Compared to the greats of the style, this one just doesn't make the mark, as much as we all seem to want it to.
",5
5840,"This is a great ale but not as good as the chimay blue or white. Nice balance of hops and malt.  Flavor is spicy, peppery and licorice.  Finish is clean crisp and lightly bittter.  Recommended
",5
5841,"Pours a nice dark gold with  a huge foamy head. Aroma of  fruit and spice leads into a nice complexity of flavor. Malt, spice, fruit, and hop bitterness all combine for a solid brew.
",5
5842,"Really strong opening numbers - rocking with the deep amber and froth of lace - violins blazing with the aromatic expression of caramel, yeats, and so many musical hints of fruits and spices.  Some of that in the heart of the set, too, especially esters and flowery hops to counterpoint the malt, but things start to fade, the band gets sloppy, the director takes a break and substance fades in favor of trailing ditties.
",5
5843,"Copper colour with a beautiful creamy head.  Nose of apricot and other subtle hints of fruit.  Taste is fruity and enjoyable.  Finish is smooth and quite enjoyable.  Subtle but beautiful.  I thought this was superior to Achel.
",5
5844,"The last bottle I had was perhaps a bit skunked.  It's hard to say.  I place this in the middle of the Chimay three.  I will rate based on past memories of the beer, more pleasant than this last bottle.
",5
5845,"Full-bodied and slightly sweet with a hint of berries and also has one of the best aftertastes of any beer to be found!
",5
5846,"Damn fine ale, great out the bottle.  I like it as it has some hop spicynesss to eat.  Fantastic.
",5
5847,"Amber/red aolour with a thin, creamy, but unfortunately not persistent head. The taste is hoppy and fruity, less sweet than other Chimays. The aftertaste has traces of vanilla. What can I say? I love trappist beers!
",5
5848,"Appearance is a hazy amber color with a white head.  Aroma is slightly fruity with heavy alcohol overtones.  Well the alcohol aroma is overwhelming in the taste as that is all I can taste.  Some slight fruit but mainly alcohol and at 6% that is unexpected and disappointing making me extremely reluctant to try their stronger beers.  Finishes dry which is to be expected.  There are much better examples for half the price.
",1
5849,"UPDATED: JAN 18, 2007 Pours a dark cloudy reddish amber color with an frothy tan head. Nose is spicy Belgian yeast with a hint of apricot.  Flavor starts with a mild sweet malt followed by some Belgian  spice with a touch of tartness. Finish is somewhat dry. Light body, creamy texture with lively carbonation.
",5
5850,"A very overrated beer. It has a great color and texture, but the taste is very lacking. I think I was unimpressed mainly because it is so hyped. I will try the Bleu and see how overrated it is.
",1
5851,"Bright red amber. Medium body with sweet herbal hop aromas. Toasty caramel malt flavors with prominent dried hop character.  Well carbonated. Somewhat sweet, but balanced with bitterness. Very nice.
",5
5852,"A really complex flavor; something you have to sit and think about with every sip.
",5
5853,"ever noticed that Belgian brown ale pretty much sucks(except for Rodenbach). This thick, sweet ale taste turns into a mucky taste after 4 or 5. GIVE ME LAGER!!!
",5
5854,"It's hard to review this beer while drinking it, as my eyes sort of roll back in my head in ecstasy.  Of the Chimay beers I've tried, this is hands-down my favorite although they are all good.  The malt sweetness seems to be better balanced in this one than the others.
",5
5855,"In my opinon the best of the red/white/blue Chimay beers. The color is a dark amber, almost reddish brown. The head is think and dissipates fairly quickly. the flavor is not as sweet as the other chimay ales. There is a slight bitterness which is  appriciated, the other chimays are amost too sweet for my taste.
",5
5856,"UPDATED: JUN 19, 2006 Wondeful dark golden pour, with a large frothy head.  Aroma of sweet fruit, with a nice balance of taste between sweet fruit and bitterness.  My favorite of the 3 main Chimay beers.
",5
5857,"UPDATED: JAN 21, 2005 Rerate: January, 21st 2005	Bottle  Red-brownish murky body.  Off-white (light-brown, faints of pink) head, which lasts mostly.  Good lace.  Nose of malts, spices.  Complex, warm flavour.  Lightly bitter, lightly sweet initial flavour.  Heavily bitter finish.  Fizzy carbonation.
",5
5858,"(330ml bottle)Orangey brown, big creamy head which leaves nice laces.  Apple, apricot, yeast and alcohol aroma.  It has malty, pepery slightly fruity flavors.  I'll drink the 750 ml bottle pretty soon and see if there's a big difference.
",5
5859,"Great dark ruby red color, with a nice head. Noticeable tastes of raisins and caramel, not as good as Chimay Bleu though.
",5
5860,"UPDATED: APR 29, 2003 Lest complex of Chimays beers. A slight taste of raisins, nether malt or hops stand out really its a refreshing beer. Could be my version of the worlds best beer to drink on a hot day but most would not agree with me here
",5
5861,"This is the best of the Chimay ales. It is so malty and yeasty. I can't get enough of this stuff and luckily it is not too expensive. If you haven't tried it...you should.

5863,"i recently had this gem of an ale fruity and very good on the palet the rich head complimentsthe exciting burst in your mouth on the aftertaste
",1
5864,"Excellent brew.  Dark amber color.  Nice complex brew with a great blend of malt and hopps flavor.  Medium bodied at best but a nice mouth feel.  Some what spicy as well.
",5
5865,"Very good, but lacking the complexity of the Bleu. Piles of pillowy head atop a burgundy amber body. This beer is rife with fruity flavors, especially cranberry, raspberry, and cherry. A medium woody hint complements the mildly spicy yeasty finish. Finishes a little syrupy.
",5
5866,"Not as good as the other two for sure. Very creamy, fluffy head. Seems lighter than the other 2 and not as flavorful. I'd drink this baby every day though...
",5
5867,"Yeah its ok. Nice n bubbly, decent weird favour thingamigig. Gosh, I liked Duvel last night better. What else? Hope the white and blue are better: its all a bit ho hum really... not a tough guy beer (that is, not for me...)

5870,"Cinnamon, clove, fruity, and walnut flavors.  Very smooth on the palate.  A dark reddish tan with lots of head.  Well carbonated but doesnt bite in your mouth.  Excellent.
",5
5871,"Beige creamy, soft and fully lasting head. Dark amber-mahogony color. Aroma is fruity and slightly spicy. Flavour is fruity too but more balanced with a slightly bitterness that appears also in the long and mellow finish. Medium to full bodied. I tasted it near the Abbey de Scourmont, Belgium.

",5
5873,"
",1
5874,"Dark amber hue, cloudy. Thin white head that disperses quickly.  Light earthy fruit (musty cherries?) on the nose with a hint of yeastiness. Medium-bodied with continuation of the earthy fruit on the palate. Very light flash of malty sweetness on the medium-long finish and some yeastiness.
",5
5875,"Creamy off-white head that holds well, smells moldy/yeasty with complex notes from King Alcohol; nice reddish-brown body with hazy appearance. Up-front lightly sweet with strong sour milk qualities. Banana, cola, prune, vanilla come together with a nice acidic/metal long finish. Carbonation is lively - not what I would consider a session beer, but fun.
",5
5876,"Rerate: Honest head; rosy-red, hazy hue; intense and inviting nose; strong and yeasty flavor, yet subtly sweet and soothing. Very smooth and drinkable, with small, tightly compacted bubbles. Very mild overall, yet not boring at all. I took it up a notch with some stinky Chimay cheese. It went unbelievably well with the beer. Addtl note: detected some interesting, candy-coated flavors. A sugary flavor that reminded me of those conical, multi-colored suckers of yesteryear. Maybe even a bit of that candy coating on Boston Baked Beans. Good stuff! But I think I like the Blue the best.
",5
5877,"UPDATED: MAY 15, 2003 Brown in color, with a thick, creamy off-white head that lingers, leaving sheets of lacing.  Aroma is malty, slightly yeasty, fruity (banana and apple).  Malty sweet start, middle is fruity with banana and some apple, and an acidic finish.  Body is on the fuller side of medium.
",5
5878,"Mahogony in color.  Very tasty.  Lacks the body of some of the other trappists, including the blue.
",5
5879,"Great beer and everything I expect out of a belgian strong ale; actually preferred this beer to Trois Pistoles and Westy 12 although it didnt stand the test next to its bigger brother, the Chimay Blanche.  Great copper color, medium body and head, suprising fruity aroma and palate - perhaps due to the properties of the yeast used in creating this fine beer.  Great balance between alcohol,carbonation and flavor.  Look out for the chunk of sediment waiting for you at the bottom of the bottle.
",5
5880,"Good mahogoney color.  Light tart aroma.  Sits well on the palate.  Not as full bodied as the bleu.
",5
5881,"Smells like something from a bowl of Halloween candy.  Bready, yeasty and very smooth.  A rather lean body.  More sweetness than others Ive tasted.  The blue is better in my opinion.
",5
5882,"UPDATED: FEB 28, 2003 (28Feb2003--750ml bottle)	A big letdown compared to the draft version.  Heavy acetaldehyde, bitter, tangy, yeasty.  Huge rocky head.  I give it a 3.2 or so.	(26Dec2002--draft) What a treat to find Chimay on tap in the U.S.	A memorable experience!  Deep red color.  Thin, bubbly, persistent,	and creamy head with good lace.

5883,"excellent Ale, i would consider this the a toss up between blue  for the best .

5885,"yes very dark red in colour. Yeasty aroma. Hugh head, very bready flavour
",5
5886,"Dark reddish amber with huge tan head. Lightly spiced yeasty nose. A well made beer be the overabundance of yeast combined with the alcohol heat spoils it for me.
",5
5887,"Aroma is more yeasty than malty.  The head was good, but not as large as I expected. The flavor is extremely smooth with one of the best finishes I have ever experienced. More drinkable than I expected, I could have a few of these.

5889,"Nothing wrong with this beer. If you like Belgian beers this is a must.

",5
5892,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2004 (75o ml bottle) Cloudy-red coloured with a big head. I wasnt as satisfied as I had thought I would be; some initial sharp bitter citrus flavour with a lasting burn of an aftertaste. Better than average but I definitely enjoy many more Belgian Ales from both sides of the Atlantic.
",5
5893,"Dark amber coloured. Nice beige head. Spicy aroma of primarily corriander. Flavour of caramel, ligth citrus and some alcahol burn. Not much aftertaste, but a decent beer though.

5894,"A vey nice beer, far out strips 98% of beers for taste, aroma and impression.  Cant rate it as high as the Bleu because it is the best of the Stable
",5
5895,"I wasnt impressed. I was just depressed.------ miss my $5
",5
5896,"Has a cider look and a wheat smell.  Taste is wheaty, but slightly bitter and finishes with an alcohol like flavor.  Overall not bad, but not my favorite.  I dont like the alcohol aftertaste that it has.
",1
5897,"Soft aroma (a bit too soft) with scents of sweet vanilla. Cloudy amber, strong thick head. I would say classy, quality feel, light in mid, stronger on aftertaste. Nicely warming. Despite lack of any superb qualities Chimay Red is well crafter brew, recommended to all
",5
5898,"Coper colored. Light fruity body. Not as good as the white or bleu, but a goot ale.
",5
5899,"This was my first Chimay. Great fruity, crisp flavor. Not at all far behind the bleu.
",5
5900,"I think this is a classic.  Its not too complex, but when a beer is this balanced and tasty it doesnt have to be.  There isnt too much of an aroma, except for refreshing yeastiness.  Im not sure how to describe the flavors, but they are integrated perfectly.  This wont knock the socks off too many people, but its a beer Id gladly drink any time.
",5
5901,"Very pretty Belgian brown.  Well structured trappist ale with quite a perfect head, reducing greacefully as you drink.  Aroma is less boozy and more complex than many Belgians.  The malt is framed so beautifully by effervescence, hops and alcohol, but I simply could not find much in the malt.  Lacking basic flavor.
",5
5902,"Re-Rate 11/22/02: A deep translucent garnet to brown color on the pour, the head preposterous in size, creamy in texture, light tan in color, with oodles of lace to cling lovingly to the Chimay Chalice. The nose is dominated by the malt, but also a hint of yeast and hops, sweet, and quite sniffable. Start is malt sweet, the top middling in mouth feel, the finish is potently acidic, mercifully hopped, droughty malt aftertaste. My second most favorite Chimay, and as I have stated, if you havent tried a Chimay, youve not lived Baby.
",5
5903,"Just wanted to amend my four favorite Belgians. Westy 12, Westy 8, Rochefort 10 and Westmalle Double. Also adjusting my score from 4.8. Too high. Thanks. Carry on.
",5
5904,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2003 Slight reddish tinted amber with a big bubbley & creamy head...aroma was spicy, like the white...lots of carbination...lots of pound-you-in-the-ass spicy yeastiness..creamy carmel..went well with slices of Chimay lait grand cru cheese...Too yeasty though IMO...but now that i know thats its the yeast i taste..I have a greater appreciation for it for some wierd reason..?? I like the Chimay White the best
",5
5905,"Nice amber colors with a decent head.  Aroma of fruit and spice. Very well balanced flavor, with a hint of spices and malts. The alcohol is well hidden. I prefer the Bleu, but this is definitely worth a try.
",5
5906,"UPDATED: JUL 4, 2006 I have tried all of the chimays (red, white, blue) and think that the red is by far the most exceptional of the three.  And since I bought a gift pack containing all three and a chimay glass, I figure that I should finally give them all a rating.  The chimay red is the least alcohol but the most complex.  It pours with an amber/copper color and a perfect head.  Many flavors persist in this ale.  The malt is perfectly balanced with light spice and bitterness.  This ale glows as it warms.  A great beligan ale.  Re-rate:  So I rated this over four years ago and now I know - its good but not *that* good.
",5
5907,"Initial pour yields a crackling, bubbly head over an intriguing ruby-amber body.  Lightly yeasty aroma, offering a complex array of figs, dates, musky cologne, tanins, and carob.  Solid Belgian malt profile, candy sugar and bananas, and some pepper.  Lightly astringent, but the yeast pour softens it up a bit.  The dry finish lingers on very nicely.  Unfortunately, the very fizzy texture kept me from thoroughly enjoying an otherwise spectacular ale.
",5
5908,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2003 I love this stuff, but the Gran Reserve is much better.  Great complexity of flavor, nice spicy, slightly fruity aftertaste.
",5
5909,"Got to admit I was expecting much more from this beer.
",5
5910,"i had one of these as part of a world beer tour at an old chicago restraunt and i can honestly say i not ready for this one. the flavor was terrible almost like a cough medicine.best left to the real conniseurs of this style
",1
5911,"lovely stuff...bought the blue as well so i am really looking forward to giving that a try
",5
5912,"UPDATED: MAY 2, 2003 This trappist ale pours a clear amber color with a big, off-white head. The head lingers and produces good lace. The aroma is fruity, spicy, and yeasty with hints of banana and malt. Medium body with full carbonation, the flavor is malty with some balance provided by the hops. The finish is sweet with a touch of malt and banana flavorings. Great ale.
",5
5913,"330ml Bottle	fruity aroma, but not overpowering.  Slightly cloudy, with small yeast particles floating.  Excellent head, and wodnerful retention of the tiny bubbles.  Not very bitter, but a stronger alcohol flavor than I was expecting...  It finished nicely however.  I will certainly buy it again.
",5
5914,"I liked it better than the bleu too. You can tell its a belgian, but its like a light belgian without the massive notes of spices and malts, but more subdued and on par with a normal spiced up ale (if you can make sense of that). And I dont mean LIGHT, at 7 percent the alkee is still hidden. Perfectly balanced. The nose was this chewy yeasty vapor trail and  the taste was spice and malts. The finish amazed me with these caramel highlights and tastes. Really good.
",5
5915,"I had the opportunity of having this aged 2 years and let me tell you it was like drinking the beer of the gods.
",5
5916,"perfect ale.
",5
5917,"Copper red color. Creamy frothy head with a network of lace. Caramel toffee nose, with hints of fruit ie. apricot, banana, and I think I smell papaya. Taste starts out similar to the nose, and ends with a subtle astringently bitter floral finish. Very nice.
",5
5918,"I have officially become a beer geek - I have purchased a corked Trappist Ale and a six of Milwaukees Best for $2.99 in the same week.  Very enjoyable, from the frothy, creamy white headed pour which leads to a dark amber appearance. Malty, fruity flavor that lasts throughout the 1.9 pint bottle.  Hard to tell that is so high in alcohol content as well as it is hidden well - the alcohol does not overwhelm the flavor - all in all, a great ale.
",5
5919,"Bottle, aged about two years.  Finally got around to rating these.  Pours a crimson tinged brown, slightly hazy, with a medium to large beiged off white head that falls quickly.  Deep old caramel and dark plum notes, with a bit of bright fruit.  Toast, smooth malt, simple but clean.  Chewy toffee, and bright lively carbonation.  Finishes up with some nice bright malt and a nice bit of toast.
",5
5920,"Pours opaque and brown, tan head slightly lighter than the blue. Aroma is nutty and spicy (cinnamon, allspice), caramel and yeast - but less dark, rich malts than the blue. Flavor is sweet and spicy with pungent yeast and a light warming finish. Medium body with lively carbonation and a complex but slightly restrained finish. Excellent dubbel.
",5
5921,"Pours a cloudy reddish amber with a nice tan head and good lacing. Aroma of caramel malts, some dark fruits. Taste is sweet malts, some belgian yeast, some plums and dates, some cherries. Palate is nice medium bodied, good carbonation. Finish is sweet malt, plums, dates, raisins, sweet spices, ending in a long nice sweet nutty aftertaste. Overall a nicely balanced and drinkable brew. Very enjoyable.
",5
5922,"330 mL bottle in a tulip. Copper colour with thin head. Balanced malt and hop.  A bit fizzt on the palate.  Overall a nice dubbel.
",5
5923,"750 ml bottle. Pours amber with a thick, long lasting off-white head. Aroma is of dark fruit, yeast and brown sugar.  Taste of dark fruit and brown sugar. Nice clean finish.
",5
5924,"Pours a deep amber with a nice lively off white head.  Aroma of belgian yeast dominates with fruit and spice.  Taste is mostly the same with darker fruits coming through and a little bit of caramel.  More subdued then the blue, but still good.  The unique belgian yeast alone makes it worth it.
",5
5925,"750ml bottle.	A great example of a Dubbel from the deep ruby color, to the lively carbonation.  Dark fruit and Belgian sugar aroma - fruity, alive flavor.  My least favorite of the three Chimay offerings, but still a great beer.
",5
5926,"750 ml bottle.  Pours hazy amber with a thick, long lasting off-white head. Aroma is of dark fruit, yeast and brown sugar.  The body is full and crisp.  Taste is a lot of dark fruit, brown sugar and spicy hops. Long lasting, dry finish.  I used to like this brew much more.  Must be my taste has changed over the years.
",5
5927,"Bottled. Burgundy. Malty, dry and rather hoppy with some toffee. Notes of banana, dry flowery finish.
",5
5928,"It has a wonderful flavor and a wonderful color. I love its exotic aroma. Beers like this are difficult to find in pubs [in Spain], and its a pity.
",5
5929,"330 mL bottle BBF 2005. This one was very very smooth and lusciously fruity and had no earth mustiness in the aroma or flavour. Even the yeast dregs tasted real good.  It reminded me very much of a slightly milder version of and I still prefer it over the blue.	Third rating: 8/24/2002: 3.9This time we rated two different  750 mL bottles, one was a use by 2002 and the other was use by 2004. Both were quite different to my previous 2 ratings (see below which were in 330 mL bottles). The 2002 750 bottle demonstrated the peat aroma and flavour that others have reported but I have not found in the 330s. The 2004 750 had no earth but strong cured meat, celery and chicken noodle soup character about it. The overall smoothness was also missing from both  750s compared to the 330s. Maybe storage is an issue here. Needs further research - a vertical rating even perhaps? 	Second rating: 8/9/2002: 4.3 Its good to have a beer like this right in the middle of rating a whole load of average stuff. It really helps you appreciate a good beer  like this and puts the rest in perspective. Everything in my original rating still stands - this is an excellent beer: Original rating: 22/6/02: 4.3 Faint hazy deep red-brown with large creamy tan lasting head. Very faint aromas when cold. When warmer, fruity hops, caramel, malt and light farmyard and doughy yeasts. Medium bodied and wonderfully smooth velvety well balanced bitter-sweet-alcohol palate from start to finish, some woody flavours in there as well. Lighter flavoured than both the Blue or White but still a great beer in its own right. I think I prefer it over both the Blue or White. Generally under rated and gains points because I could drink 3-4 of these at a sitting quite easily.
",5
5930,"UPDATED: OCT 10, 2006 11.2 oz.  Inevitably pours with a creamy persistent foam.  Modest, yet refined aroma of plums and maraschino.  Hints of cotton candy, pepper, and leather in there as well.  Medium body.  Watery middle reminiscent of cherry Kool-Aid.  Straightforward flavors of white grape, cantaloupe, fig, and slick cherry-like malt.  Only the slightest hint of toastiness in the mostly hop/yeast finish.  Sadly, this has become a run of the mill dubbel and doesnt begin to reach complexity.  I also hold much higher standards for the Trappists.  Ill take my Allagash Dubbel any day over this.
",1
5931,"UPDATED: APR 15, 2011 Bottle@SomePub, Apr 2011, 3.5: Light malty, light fruity and light herbal aroma. Light hazy, brown, beige head, fair lace. Herbal, light malty, more malts in the finish, light bitter. Medium body, dry start. Easy and balanced. Bottled, Oct 2002, 3.9: Light banana aroma and lightly smoked. Dark brown, off-white creamy head, good lace. Light sweet, light banana, light spicy. Little bitterness in the finish.
",5
5932,"Finally number 100 and it was nothing short of wonderful. Of corse that is expected of chimay having already had the blue and tan I knew this on would have to be great. It wasnt quite asa good as the blue but none the less great in itself. Deep reddish color with a big head. Aroma of exotic fruit and spice is almost intoxicating by itself. The first taste sets your tastebuds dancing in your mouth with malt and hop mixed giving a fruity earthy sensation that iss simply amazing. If you havent tried this or any of the Chimay line I highly recommnd and insist you try them.
",5
5933,"Yeasty, baked bread-like nose with a wonderfully smooth, rounded mouthfeel.   Thick off-white head, somewhat malty sweet body.   My nose is a little stuffed up at the moment so I did not get any of the fruity aromas.   Crisp, drying finish.   Nice stuff, like a meal in a bottle.
",5
5934,"Not as spicy and complex as its cousin the Grand reserve, this is still a wonderful Trappist Ale that gives a mix of cinnamon and vinilla with a complex malty flavor
",5
5935,"
",1
5936,"Medium brown color, large lacy head. Malty, fruity and spicy. Smooth mellow taste. Lots of flavor, complex and subtle. Hint of apricot, banana, vanilla and other spices and aromas. Mouthfeel is very full and round. Finish is smooth and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Great beer. My favorite of the red, white and blue.
",5
5937,"UPDATED: MAR 13, 2004 Thick pillowy head. Amber brown Aroma of red wine,light yeast and apricot if you are looking for it. Silky smoothness. Alcohol warming in the back of the throat. Flavour is much more agreeable as my palate improves from my first tasting. Malty, dry, hoppy, slight earthy quality. Light notes of chocolate, licorice, alcohol.
",5
5938,"UPDATED: MAY 21, 2010 Aroma has mostly raisin and caramel malts. hazy, brown coloured beer with an off-white, big head. The taste is quite sweet, carbonated and a bit unbalanced.		Original rating from 2002: 4.1 Appearance is great, especially in my Chimay-glass. Well balanced taste, this sure is a brother of the Chimay Blue.
",1
5939,"This one is a good one, a bit less character than the bleu, but still very good.

5940,"(99)ninety-nine beers on the wall,(99) ninety-nine beers, take one down pass it around ninety(9?),..Wait NO.. we count up on this site not down, and I am almost there,to 100 it may not seem like a lot to many, but it is to me. Some people have 100 ratings in a month its taken me almost 4 months. I am just hoping Fed-Ex delivers my package (beer trade) tomorrow for a fantastic #100, Ok on with the beer ratings. Deep rusty colored, malty sweet, as dry a finish as a James Bond Martini,I prefer the Bleu, can you say YEAST ?This aftertaste ought to last until Monday. I am glad we are expected to get 4 inches of rain tomorrow or otherwise I would be high & dry from this Ale, still Highly Recommended !
",5
5941,"I was not very surprised of this beer. Though it has a fine colour and a creamy head, the complexity is not very high. I found some notes of fruit and yeast and that the alcohol is mild. Nothing extraordinairy.
",1
5942,"Dark red colour with thick cream head.  Ample carbonation and strong coriander nose, with some sweet malty and yeast nuances. Fairly complex flavour profile, buscuits, bread, sweet maltiness, coriander, sweet orange, etc.
",5
5943,"It is another classic.  I find it difficult to dislike these Trappist ales.  Such complex yet refreshing flavors exist in this one.  Lots of fruitiness but it does not go overboard with the fruitiness.  the richness of the malt complements the fruit flavors wonderfully and the high carbonation keeps the flavors dancing on the tongue throughout the tasting experience.
",5
5944,"Very nice beer. Beautiful deep orange color. Strong clove aroma and taste. Mild hops, not bitter at all.
",5
5945,"When money allows I want to try this side by side with the grande reserve. I was a bit less impressed with this, however I feel that I need to try it again to do a fair comparison. Screw this comparison crap...how does it stand alone? Well, this was rather malty and nicely fruity. Like its blue labeled sibling this wonderful beer has undertones of currant and apricot but has an appealing maltiness that is all its own. (Im comparing and contrasting again arent I) I didnt catch the touch of bitterness described above, I actually thought this was incredibly smooth and was rather impressed with its lack of bitterness being so attractive to its overall flavor.
",5
5946,"Copper orange color.  Nice white head but doesnt last very long.  Nose of bananas, cherries.  Dry and a little spicy with a good amount of malt.  Clean and smooth.  A very good beer all around.
",5
5947,"Malty/yeasty/bready aroma...Hazy orange/amber color with a big honecombed head and patchwork lace--nice retention...Flavor features a steady mild malt underlay with moderate hop bite and a nice spiciness that tastes of allspice and cloves...The spiciness continues into the tingly dry finish---bready overtones here as well...Body showcases the firm malt foundation, augmented by the effervescent carbonation and well-judged hop dryness.  It has a substantial mouthfeel but also has a nice buoyancy to it. In sum, this is a solid product, if not offering the rainbow of tastes and olfactory sensations of the elite Belgian offerings...Still, quite enjoyable...
",5
5948,"Classic Belgian, just doesnt have the sweetness and mouthfeel of Orval.
",5
5949,"Nice amber semi transperant color with a nice foaming head that lasts. Hints of fruits, balanced sweetness and a nice peppery and bitter finish. I prefer Blue but its still a damn good beer!
",5
5950,"UPDATED: MAY 30, 2003 This beer had a nice head, dry and flavorful taste.  Nice aftertaste with a mild bite.  Malty and dark.  There was an armoa and taste of chocolate, clove, and wood.  It's a very natural tasting brew.
",5
5951,"I prefer this to the white (hope my rating reflects this - I cant remember).  Looks great, nice aroma with a touch of spice, very smooth flavour.  Probably the easiest Chimay to drink, but not the nicest.
",5
5952,"Pleasant spiciness in aroma and taste.  Goes down smooth.
",5
5953,"The chimay-taste is quite obvious. I think it is the best Chimay and it is a good competitor to the other trappist dubbel ales.
",5
5954,"bittersweet, my least favorite of the red white and blue but still awesome
",5
5955,"pours with a nice head.  lovely fruity, woody aromas.  burnt sugar, raisins and big maltiness.  very tasty.
",5
5956,"Not quite as good as the Bleu, amberish copper color, excellent soft head, fruity aroma, lots of malt in the aftertaste, another great brew from Chimay
",5
5957,"YUCK. this smelled bad, tasted funny, and was nowhere near as good as the other belgian style beers Ive had and this is acutaly belgian.  Im gunna wait for blue to come around
",1
5958,"If the white and blue caps are better I just might stop drinking anything that isnt Chimay...
",5
5959,"Nose is very floral.  Highly carbonated. Amber color. Clove present & sweet.  A bit woody.  I like the blue better personally.
",5
5960,"The best of  starters of the Trappist.    Available across the US, good flavor, aroma and appearance, you cant go wrong with this one!
",5
5961,"Pours a nice ruby color, decent head, with a stellar model lace. Smells of fruits, raisins, carob and oak. Taste is fruity up front, with some nice spicy malts and a hint of hop for balance. Light to medium body, with a hyper -active mouthfeel. Very drinkable, complex, and classy, as all Chimays various versions seem to be. Another winner
",5
5962,"Coarse, bubbly head.  Highly carbonated and slightly cloudy.  Amber.  Clove rpesent in aroma and flavor.  Slightly woody.
",5
5963,"Absolutely beautiful! Nice clove and floral aroma/flavor. I actually enjoy this over the blue. I guess because it retains the wonderful complex aroma/flavor as the blue, but its a little easier to drink. Great great great great great!
",5
5964,"RE-rate:a lovely Trappiste ale, yeasty dry acidity, malty, light to medium body, creamy and rounded, i reckon its really good, even though its not the most insane of Belgian brews, very solid, always reliable, never lets you down in hours of need.
",5
5965,"Surprisingly sparkling. The alcohol is very well hidden. I like this, but Id rather have a Westmalle Dubbel.
",5
5966,"Reddish coppery colour. Big quickly dissipating head. Very nice medium sweet and spicy aroma. Flavour is spicy, but less fruity than the other Chimays. Finish is only lightly bitter and quite refreshing. However, the body is too thin and watery in order for this to truly be a top beer.
",5
5967,"RE-RATE: Ahh, Chimay Red, its been a while.  I decided to retry it and found that I liked it a lot more this time around.  The prominent yeastiness was quite appealing and it had a lot more in common with Chimay Bleu than I remembered.  Used to be a 3.9, Im kicking it up some.		ORIGINAL RATING: This is my least favorite of the three chimays, but that isnt necessarily a bad thing!  Hints of nuts, slight fruitiness, and a little bit of a woody flavor make this a delightfully complex beer.  Maybe it was just the bottle I had, but the finish seemed a little off.
",5
5968,"A little less complex than the Bleu. But a bit easier to drink also.  The balance of this beer is almost perfect.  Body is much lighter than its dark amber color would have you believe.  It is not as flavorful as either Chimay Bleu or White.  But its another enjoyable Trappist Ale.
",5
5969,"UPDATED: NOV 14, 2007 Lightly sweet, spicy, fruity aroma.  Deep brick-red color, very much opaque and unfiltered (bottle swirled).  Balance is amazing in this beer, the profile is overall, malty, but there is a very nice, spicy hop bitterness that follows right along.  Flavor progression is very meandering and almost artistic.  Finish goes on for a day and a half, and it has a very intriguing orange-spice aftertaste.  Carbonation, head, and lace are all there.  Body is medium-full.  Excellent!
",5
5970,"A beutiful dark brown color. It has a light aroma of fruit and a good head. It has a slight aroma of hop bitternes. It is very drinkable but somewhat boring. If I could choose between this and Chimay Bleu I would never drink Chimay Rouge (and I very seldom do)
",1
5971,"Deep red/brown colour with a big dense head, fruity aroma, with a great mouthfeel and fruity flavours. A great beer, not as good as the blue but better than the white IMO.
",5
5972,"One of the best Belgians.  I love it lots.  Fruit flavors with nice alcohol hints.  A great fall and spring drink.
",5
5973,"Red and slightly spicy.  Very nice aroma.  Very much like the Chimay Bleu but not really as good.  A bit stickier and maltier.  Still a quality beer.
",5
5974,"This is a great brew. Probably my third favorite though in the trilogy
",5
5975,"IMO more fullnes than the ""white"" one,tastes of fruit and yeast,hard to tell though,had it in a ""Chimay"" cupglas and as useally here in sweden they serve it too cold
",5
5976,"Huge spicy fruity aroma.  The flavour doesnt quite stand up so well though - a bit thin.  Almost some cherry notes to it.  The bitterness does make it a bit more interesting but doesnt flow so well.  Ill stick with blue.
",5
5977,"Beautiful full spicy aroma.  Fruit notes.  Color is hazy amber. fruit, and spice on the palate.  very well balanced.  Finishes with the perfect amount of bitterness.  One of my favorite belgians I do believe.
",5
5978,"Not as great as i hoped. But its still a very good beer with an interesting taste and a great malty flavor.
",5
5979,"A lovely ale. This and <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/ShowBeer.asp?BeerID= are my favorite Belgian ales to date. Chimay is a bit smoother, but Orvals head and aroma are unbeatable.
",5
5980,"Reddish brown beer with a decent tan head. Nothing really jumps out in the nose.As it warms up the flavors definately develop until at room temperature(on a SoCal summer day) this has got a great flavor.Not complex or anything just a nice beer.
",5
5981,"Red-copper color with large off-white head.  Aroma of biscuit malt and fruit with a flowery hop bouquet.  Taste echoes the aroma - very estery with a grape, dry finish.  This is what I think of when I imagine a Belgian in my head.  Great beer.
",5
5982,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2004 Not a great belgian. Chimay have lacked quality in recently outings. Certainly a drinkable beer however.
",5
5983,"Corked bottle.  Had this to celebrate the end of a long exam.  A rich dark color.  I found this a little too dry.  It was spicy and fruity but not as rich or complex as the Bleu.
",5
5984,"An all-time great beer. Slightly sweet, but with real beer flavor. One of my top five beers of all time.
",5
5985,"UPDATED: APR 29, 2003 POurs with a red-brown/mohagony body topped by a thick foamy head with a good amount of lace left behind.  Slightly sweet and fruity aroma with an underlying spicyness and a woody character.  Slightly sweet and fruity malt flavor with a spicy yeasty background.  Full bodied and tingling on the tongue.
",5
5986,"The most overrated beer - ever. Granted this beer is good, but its a waste of money unless youre a beer snob. Guinness still beats the ever-living sh*t out of it.
",5
5987,"Softer in flavor to Blue. One of my personal favorates. Well balanced and a great ale. Highly recommended.
",5
5988,"Not as good ad the blue, but still a good experience. I like the sweetness. Perhaps good as someones first trappist beer.

5989,"Very good belgian ale, exactly what youd expect from monks.
",5
5990,"what i am rating here is the 1987 vintage available at the kulminator (antwerp) which held up very well to time gone is almost all hop and malt charachter leaving behind more of a port like beer with very fine carbonation a good aroma somewhat of a diminishing head but leaving lace and a quite unique flavor seek this place out if you go

5991,"Amber brown colour, big head, a little fizzy, long aftertaste.
",5
5992,"the bottom end for chimay, but light-years above many others

5993,"I love Chimay! Although Blue is my favorite, both the Red and the White are delicious. The Red had lots of carbonation and great flavor. Just a great beer.

5994,"To be honest, i expected more of this one. Malty, creamy. The other Chimays are better.
",5
5995,"Nice dark orange color, fuity malty aroma, creamy.
",5
5996,"UPDATED: FEB 23, 2005 Dozens of subtle delicacies once roamed in this one...Black currants, prunes, white grapes and raspberries...Brown sugar, birch, tea, smoke...Today, coriander and orange zest prevail in a pleasant yet tranquil, candyish nose but the body and flavors resort to a tinny, fizzy mineral character which dishonors its predecessors...A minute one amongst many, as if it was put in an old persons home, sedated with unknown substances, awaiting death...
",1
5997,"Still prefer the blue one, but this one ranks with the top.

5999,"6/22/02- Ryans Sports Bar, Wards Center Honolulu HI. A dark iced tea color, malty nose. Quite lively carbonation. Mouthfeel was just right! This place had great service and delicious food. The staff was very friendly, like meeting long lost buddies! I had the oysters and focaccio. Highly recomended!

6000,"Taste can be better.  Great colour!
",5
6001,"Spicy aroma, particularly cloves.  Fruity/clove flavour, palatable but no way near as good as the other Chimays.
",5
6002,"Not as good as I had hoped.  I was disappointed.  I liked the fruity aspects of the beer, but overall it was just missing something.  It was unbalanced.  However, this tasted kind of like a hybrid between a wine and a beer.  Im not so sure I liked that either.  It is definately a good beer worth trying, but it definately doesnt live up to the hype.  Definately not worth $6 for a 12 ounce bottle either.
",5
6003,"Great but I prefer The Bleu one
",5
6004,"Re rating: somethings changed: either my palate, the beer itself (doubtful after all these decades) or the care with which it was stored, but the last few samples of this brew have been terrific. Softer and less potent than the Blue, but still very appetizing. Very drinkable at 7%.  Yum.

6005,"Not a big fan of Chimay, although they are solid quality beers. Great forward taste, balanced carbonation. I do enjoy this one - just wish it wasnt so darn expen$ive.

6010,"Deep clear burgundy pour with a thick light tan head with outstanding retention. Aroma is dark fruits, raisins, sweet malt, grapes. Taste is dark fruit, molasses, raisin, and the light sweetness of Belgian yeast and candi sugar. Palate is velvety smooth with a perfect carbonation level. Nothing mind-blowing here, just a great classic abbey ale from the country that does them best.
",5
6011,"Bottle. Poured a ruby red. Nose is very yeasty with light malts. Very mild and subtle with fruity notes. Creamy mouthful almost buttery, with classic Belgian candied sugars and yeasts. Not too sweet, almost dry. This is fairly mild and smooth, with the subtle but well crafted flavors.

6013,"33cl. bottle. Its been a long time since I had this. It tasted better than I remember. Reddish brown with frothy white/tan head. Flavors of bread, raisin, spices. Sweet with mild bitterness.
",5
6014,"Bottle; Pour is a dark, hazy brown/amber with a modest off white head. Retention is light, lacing is nonexistant in this Chimay glass. Brown sugars, raisins, sweet breads on the nose. Light spice note, dark fruits, brown sugars, mild hop presence, mouth feel is medium , finish is slightly bitter but the sweetness is present throughout the flavor profile. This is my kind of Belgian -
",5
6015,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2003 Brown color, frothy head.  Spicy aroma.  Lingering, semi-bitter aftertaste.  A very nice beer and a definite must-have.  Much better after I had a few other Belgians under my belt and could notice and appreciat the complexities.
",5
6016,"Okay, opening this was akin to open a champagne bottle. Lovely amber color with nice white/light tan head. Nice taste to it and a mouthfeel that most macrobrews brag about and dont even come close or actually denegrate. I love it, but I wish it wasnt so expensive.
",5
6017,"Solid, mahogany body, creamy head of beige foam. Aroma and flavor both show notable yeast. Slightly tannic and acidic in flavor but balanced out with some raspberry like sweetness. A touch of oak may have been the cork, as I left this on its side for over 6 months. Sweetness lingers well into the aftertaste again ressembling raspberries, drying out as it lingers.
",5
6018,"UPDATED: OCT 7, 2003 More pronounced flavours than the Bleu. Cinnamon and toffee come across on the tongue and the nose, slight vinous notes, excellent balance of sweetness. My fave of the Chimays.
",5
6019,"Pours a bit browner than ruby. Nice typical belgian head. Nose has that smell thats the same in the La Trappe beers; its like the taste of suger in the raw if you took away the sweetness. Maybe its from the sugar they use to start fermentation. Some very faint citric qualities to the smell with some other vague fruitiness. Im not sure how many people here have done this or have this weed, but chew on the bottom end of a stalk of Y grass (peel away the secondary leaves and chew on the white bottom). Its a flavor that very similar to one of those in this beer. Flavor it with a little bit of red grapes, minus the sweetness, with the faintest hint of alcohol and youve got the flavor nailed. The mouthfeel is actually fuzzy because of the way the carbonation is.
",5
6020,"Highly carbonated when pouring, large head. Once it settles it is less gassy. Has a great aroma, sweet, caramel like smell.Slightly bitter taste, though the various flavors stick in your mouth. As it fades, a nice smooth sweet flavor remains. A solid beer- a must have !
",5
6021,"Heavily carbonated autumn brown appearance.  Feint prickly, woody hop aroma translating into rather similar flat, punchless flavor. Medium-to fuller bodied--this beer is belly warmer, but it lacks sharpness/crispness. Quite dissapointing--maybe do to a flat bottle.
",1
6022,"UPDATED: JUN 12, 2003 This beer strikes my chord.  From the rich head (better than the White on this mark) and bruin color, to the balance of carbonation and flavors...gosh, what a beer.  The aroma is a bit softer than other top beers, and the flavor might be accused of not being the *most* complex, but this is wondrous beer in my book.  Re-rate (June 2003): a bit thinner than I remembered.  The aroma is attractive of pear and apple, and the caramel is decent, but it lacks a certain depth.  The best is when you get the yeast from the bottom.
",5
6023,"Not as good as the blue.
",5
6024,"Not as strong tasting as the bleu but Stronger than the cinq cents. By far, when it comes to flavor this is teh best tasting of the Chimays.
",5
6025,"Only one beer comes close to the Chimay Premiere.  Thats the Chimay Blue.  The aroma, the color, the taste.  I cannot begin to explain my love for this beer.  Its a sit down, smoke a cigar and enjoy type beer.  It can be enjoyed at room temperature, however, I prefer it pretty darn cold.  Great with strong cheeses, stews, and nuts.
",5
6026,"UPDATED: APR 2, 2006 100% blind rating.		Head is initially large, frothy, off-white, mostly lasting.		Body is hazy dark amber, bottle conditioned.		Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), lightly to moderately yeasty (mold, cobwebs), with notes of orange peel, cola, clove.		Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.	Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.		Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.		Bring the noise, doubters.  Had no idea this was being poured, and my rating went DOWN from when I rated it non-blind (3.0 at last rating).
",1
6027,"I was only familiar with the Grande Reserve prior to drinking this one.  Significanly more mild.  The familiar fruitiness was still evident, but just not as complex.  Certainly worth drinking.
",5
6028,"Great stuff, not bad for tasting like furniture polish. Yum.
",5
6029,"Redbrown and a nice head.	light taste of strawberries and bananas and nearly perfectly balanced.
",1
6030,"Redish-brown,fruity, a classic no one can deny,its biggest problem is its name,never meets its expectations nor can it live up to its big brother Blue.
",5
6031,"Cloudy, yeasty appearance with a tawny color. Very fruity aroma and flavor with a slightly oaky finish.
",5
6032,"Smells of yeast and malt. Plum colour, creamy head. Cyclone of carbonation in center of glass. Tastes of plums, raisins and dough. Fabulous mouthfeel. Fantastic these corked ones.
",5
6033,"A light brown beer with a light taste.It is ok but nothing really special.
",5
6034,"A truly interesting experience. Had my first one last night and was pleasantly suprised by its flavor. Great on the palate. IT had a slight fruity taste. well worth the money.
",5
6035,"Considering that this came in a giant corked bottle - I was more than slightly disappointed at the average-ness of the taste.
",1
6036,"My first corked beer (I know, I know) and my second Belgian Ale. This blew the Witkap Pater out of the water (does that rhyme?) but I still feel it was lacking in some areas. Copper colored with an insanely thick head. Mellow fruit undertones are about all that stood out to me. I am looking forward to trying the Bleu.
",1
6037,"Not as good as I remembered it. I could taste the cork for one thing. Head insignificant. Color, cloudy, medium brown. Very yeasty. Sour finish. Vinous and earthy, some fruitiness, but mouthfeel is thin and overall flavor not particularly  complex. Maybe not the freshest bottle...
",5
6038,"A smooth ale, but a sharp aftertaste became unpleasant after awhile. Fair head, dry finish; however, fine compliment to a seafood dinner.
",1
6039,"Vinuous aroma & deep clear ruby body. Sour, bitter red wine flavour. More like a sparkling wine than anything, but in this case its not a critisism. Will often suffer in comarison to its similarly priced big blue brother.
",5
6040,"Full bodied. Malty, some fruitiness (apple, blackcurrant). Bitter finish. Very well brewed and delicious beer, but lacks in taste and complexity compared to a Rochefort.
",5
6041,"Very nice Belgian. Had a fruity aroma, with an alcoholy dry finish that was great. As I let this one sit I liked it even more.
",5
6042,"Appearance: Dark caramel brown, slightly hazy. Thick, lingering, creamy beige-colored foam head. 		Aroma: Yeasty nose; toasted nut, stone fruit, malty. 		Flavor: Big, filling, malty; dried apricot, bread dough, a slight woody tang.
",5
6043,"Call me strange but I did not found this beer matching the expectations I had. I especially disliked the aftertaste. Perhaps I tried this a bit too early in my beer tasting career.
",1
6044,"Light malt nose and dark amber color. Full taste with	a dry finish. Sophisticated by very smooth. The fine	bubbles contribute to a wonderful texture. Though very	special, I can drink this all day long.  Has rightfully	earned its status.
",5
6045,"belgium at its finest.  very sweet, perfect sipper.
",5
6046,"Pretty good.
",5
6047,"good, but very tough to find.
",5
6048,"UPDATED: AUG 16, 2003    I liked this better than the white...It was smoother and more flavorful. Fruity, almost minty malt flavor, vinous yet still somewhat creamy texture. Slightly spicy, lightly yeasty.  Could have packed a little more flavor I suppose, as this is a bit light for a trappist but definitely has a great head retention and almost perfect balance,  Fabulous beer.
",5
6049,"When opening a bottle of this proceed with caution. There is so much carbonation that I literally thought that I wasnt going to get to have any of it since it was pouring on the bar. This was a very hard beer for me to find, but once found, was worth the effort. I enjoyed the rich taste with hops that were not overpowering. Worth every penny. On to finding the rest of these beers.
",5
6050,"I love all the Chimay beers.  This one has a great berry taste with a hint of smooth plain chocolate.
",5
6051,"A heftly bottle of this was my introduction to Beerpagne.  This brew pours a dark murky	hazel caramel.  The large frothy mostly diminishing head is off-white with virtually no	lacing.  The moderate nose is a complex mix of moderate grain, hay, caramel, grass, resin,	citrus, earth, raisin, vanilla, cola, and alcohol.  The flavor is balanced with a light start	featuring sweetness acidity, and bitterness.  The long finish is also balanced with	everything from the start being moderate with an addition of vanilla, caramel, anise,	pepper, and lemon/lime citrus tones.  The palate is the only glaring weak point in my	opinion.  The body is light to medium, the texture is dry, and the finish has a strong	astringency combined with a metallic texture.  The problem for me here is the excessive	carbonation that I can only compare to cheap champagne.  It really ruined the experience	for me.  A good brew that would be beyond stellar if the bubbles would be halved.
",5
6052,"Just come back from the pub and have had a few of these - heavy but with a pleasant flavour and appetising taste
",1
6053,"I cant say that I was overly impressed by this one. The alcohol taste way overpowers its light body, and overall it does not come close to the Blue, or even to the Ommegang that I have been enjoying over the past few days.
",5
6054,"Just like the rest of the world states...not as good as the Blue.  Very similar IMHO though.  Less carbonated then the Blue which I am not sure is good or bad.  The flavors of the red are toned down a little from the Blue.  I liked this Chimay a lot though.
",5
6055,"A decent enough trappist, but not up there with the Chimay Blue. This one is just a little too much on the sweet side for my tastes.
",5
6056,"Yeah, bacially a weaker version of the blue....lets call it Chimay Blue Light.  All in all a very good trappist. Medium bodied, very well balanced with fruits and pleasant hops.
",5
6057,"One smooooth trap. A dark caramel color and a wonderful malt flavor. The perfect hop character.
",5
6058,"thick caramel brown color.  mine was very carbonated, but not much head at all.  nice slightly bitter taste, some fuity sweetness.  overall, very good.
",5
6059,"UPDATED: MAY 19, 2005 March 2002:  I agree for the most part with Oakes on this one; its a solid, light Trappist, not particularly complex or distinguished and certainly not the best from this fine brewer.  Lovely thick brown appearance with just a hint of head that sticks around; nice slightly spicy, malty nose; full strong flavor with a medium very balanced profile, and a solid warming finish.  Not spectacular, but like all the Chimays a pretty good deal (as far as expensive Belgians go, anyway). 7/5/8/4/17 4.1		May 2005:  11.2 oz bottle, probably a fresh one.  Fairly clear ruby-orange, moderate frothy-wet head that decays disappointingly fast...malty, lightly vinous nose disfigured a bit by a touch of burnt rubber, some sour spiciness creeping in...wet, malty, slightly citrusy-acidic mouthfeel, vinegary middle, bitter sharp peppery finish...moderate-to-heavy carbonation really helps this out, on the whole I find it pretty average for a dubbel these days.
",1
6060,"A very nice Chimay, even though its unspectacular. Nice aroma and palate. Not as bubbly as the Bleu, and therefore more easily drunk.
",5
6061,"Very sweet and a great belgian ale.
",5
6062,"UPDATED: FEB 17, 2003 As all Chimay's I loved them. This ale is great!
",5
6063,"A sweet beer with a dry and bitter flavor that will suprise you.  Those monks can make some good beer.
",5
6064,"A sweet flavor that dry and a bit bitter, but in a good way.  Semi-sweet aftertaste.  Unique beer.
",5
6065,"Very sweet and complex flavor with a clear alcoholic sting the malts and hops cannot hide. A very heavy beer, its impossible for me to drink many of these in a row.
",5
6066,"This is like a champagne of beer. Very fizzy and bubbly, which gives it a fresh taste over the already well-crafted trappist ale flavor. This was a nice treat.
",5
6067,"Almost like a champagne head, and quite a bit of carbonation, but through it all is a really nice malty flavor, and a complex elegance of delivery that makes you feel like a god!
",5
6068,"Far less raisin aroma and taste than other recent Belgians Ive enjoyed. Subtle stuff way down in there, fruits I never knew existed, like the oddly-colored ones in the small baskets at the grocers...but also flavors of Coca Cola and clove, stronger than the rest. Coupled with the real thinness of body, I was a bit negatively surprised. I did expect something different, more. That being said, this is incredibly easy to drink, and one could(well, I could) get into serious trouble if this were more easily accessible.
",5
6069,"elegant enough to show off with a fuente opus X cigar! The best meal ive had in weeks.
",5
6070,"Great beer, smooth, medium bodied, silky finish.  Perfect in the Chimay glass.  Definitely better Belgium beers, only hard to get in America
",5
6071,"More yeasty than the White, more aroma than the Bleu.  I really liked this one.
",5
6072,"HUGE head. but thats about it. this was one of those beers that i had such high expectations for (from reading reviews like these at ratebeer) and was just a tad disappointed.		granted, it was one single of the big bottles, maybe a bad batch? but nothing special, imho.		all i know is that i seem to be getting better tasting belgian beers from the microbreweries here in the USA than i am finding from belgium itself.		freshness issue?? 		hype?
",1
6073,"Not as full flavored as Blue.
",5
6074,"Simply excellent to drink.  I love this beer due to its drinkability as well as its pedigry and lineage.  It is more affordable and lighter than the Blue and as such offers better value for the serious drinker.  I still prefer the Blue as an ale to sit back and enjoy, but this is a really enjoyable, easy to drink, trappist ale with an interesing history.  Very nice.
",1
6075,"A pleasant drink, fruity palate with apricots. slightly sweet finish.
",5
6076,"Very fruity and bubbly.  Tasty, but not near the perfection of the blue.
",5
6077,"Full of flavour and a bit sweet.
",5
6078,"hard not to set aside the bias that comes with this product: the elegant packaging and stratospheric pricing.  it has a wire muzzle like a police dog,  it has a thick substansial bottle and a champagne style cork, its blessed by bacchus and the pope and michael jackson;  trying to set all this aside and evaluate it for myself, i see a deep orange brown nectar the color of an old leather suitcase (p. 1675); almost as brown as the bottle itself.  a beautiful exuberant display of bubbles upon unleashing; light beige, bubblebath head, diminishing. first pour is hazy, consomme rather than chunky soup, but plenty of flotsam remains in the bottle: i paid for that stuff, im gonna drink it, screw careful decanting.  the aroma is spicy dry apple cider, i surprisingly dont find the yeast overpowering, perhaps im faint with thirst. its sweeter than first surmised by the smell, its apple sauce, pear and nutmeg, vaguely peppery. rather sweet but hugely drinkable.  cant wait to try the bleu...
",5
6079,"I think the red is my favorite Chimay.  It has the most earthy, yeasty character that I love in Chimays ales.  Dont get me wrong, I like them all.  And it does seem to be better in the large, corked bottle than the small capped one.  I have always read that it is better after being laid down for about three years, but I dont have the patience.  However, I plan to start a small beer cellar, so check my review in 2005...
",5
6080,"The most easily drinkable of the Chimay lines, but the least complex.
",5
6081,"Bread malt and fruit aromas with a hint of yeastiness and raisins in the taste, visually appealing and easily drinkable.
",5
6082,"maybe I am missnig something here.  I thought it was ok, but did not live up to the Chimay hype.RE-RATE 1/23/02. Still a very bland taste and thin watery mouthfeel when compared to the other 2.
",5
6083,"This has a full bodied flavor without the complexity of the bleu.  I didnt notice the floral and berry like flavors on the palate. Very Good in its own right.
",5
6084,"Really a fine ale. Very different than most abby ales I have tried. Seemed to come on stronger as I got further down the bottle. The bleu is not available in my neck of the woods but I will look for it on my travels as many ratings here deem it even better.
",5
6085,"just as good as the bleu
",5
6086,"Not my favorite Chimay.  It starts more bitter than I like, and the taste is woody and reminiscent of rootbeer.  I do like the fruitiness, and the bitter finish doesnt linger, at least.  Overall not bad, just not my favorite Belgian.  If I had started my Chimay experience with this one, it might have stopped with this one as well, and I would have missed out on Bleu.
",5
6087,"I had a 33cl bottle which poured perfectly into the goblet.  Nice had and copper color.  Aroma became more apparent to me when I got halfway through the beer.  Taste has a hint of wood, malt gave me a crisp impression at first.  A fine Belgian Ale.
",5
6088,"This was a very tasty beer.  It complimented dinner (steamed Mussels) very well.
",5
6089,"750ml bottle. Semi-hazy light amber with a frothy white head. Flakes of suspended yeast (prior to yeast pour). Musty yeast aroma with honey, tropical fruit and some herby spiciness. Bubbly body at first with a good dose of coriander, ginger, yeast and light candied sugar. Watery body beneath the bubbles. Nice flavor just lacks malt depth. Adding the immense amount of yeast made this less palatable. Too yeasty and mushy for me in the end. Could use a lot of aging or maybe a pour without the 1/2 of yeast.
",5
6090,"UPDATED: JUL 31, 2004 Dark amber color with a big beige head and lots of lacing. Aroma of yeast and spices. Flavor is a little sweet, malty, fruity, acidic, and toffee.
",5
6091,"tried in the 33CL bottle. nice creamy head, very fruity aroma, reminiscent of a dry red wine..also detected mild aroma of wood. dry from beginning through the finish
",5
6092,"Re-rate: Young bottle 9/01	A beautiful cloudy copper/red/brown. Moderate white, rocky, persistent collar. When I first uncorked, foam exploded! Not sure why. Was sitting stationary for a long time. Yeasty, fruity nose. Soft body, starts out yeasty, then a mellow maltiness takes over, smooth fruitness and an earthy character finishes it up, nice alcohol presence..subtle spicyness, slightly acidic, a great beer.  Has that divine chimay house flavor....recommended. The blue is still the champ though.
",5
6093,"Top marks for appearance & palate.  Dry, earthy, tawny Belgian ale.  Somewhat tart in the finish.  I like Ommegang somewhat better, but well-done.  One could certainly drink a lot of this with no problems.
",5
6094,"Earthy and mellow.
",5
6095,"Bottle.  Dark hazed brown with a thick off-white head.  Brown sugar, spice, dark fruit on aroma.  Sweet brown sugar and toast body with yeasty spice, date, a hint of ripe banana and leather.  Very nice example of a style I usually dont have a strong love for.  Cant believe how long Ive been seeing these Chimay bottles on shelves without trying them.
",5
6096,"Pours a very cloudy, hazy brown with a very thin head. Some spice and fruit flavors. Lot of carbonation. Very good beer.
",5
6097,"25 oz. bottle.  Pours brown with off-white head. Fruity aroma with raisins. Smooth mouthfeel with a satisfying finish.  An absolutely stellar beer!
",5
6098,"Brown. Aroma is molasses, fruity, brown sugar, spice. Somewhat creamy mouthfeel, malty, nice long finish.
",5
6099,"Bottle 33 cl. Poured brown colour with off-white head. Aroma is fruity mixed with some spices and raisins. Flavour is a bit sweet, some fruitiness. Quite nice beer.
",5
6100,"Reddish, light brown color. Hazy and cloudy.  Thick wispy head.  Very pronounced bread and yeast smell. A little bit of spice and some fruit.  Some sweet Malty flavors. Bready and grains. Some spice and some black pepper. Also some light fruit flavors like pear and dates. Overall, fairly sweet with a little sourness. Not much hop bitterness. Light to medium body.  Very smooth.
",5
6101,"The aroma is light, but then again I on the third Chimay of the night.  the appearance is a cloudy copper with a cream head.  the taste is of sourdough bread with a somehow sweet aftertaste?  This beer goes down smooth and is easy to drink, overall a nice beer.
",5
6102,"Bottle. Hazy reddish brown with a huge foam that keeps overflowing the bottle for several minutes. Aroma: yeast, some fruit. Taste: spices, yeast, some fruit, medium-sweet, medium-bitter. Medium-bodied with high carbonation. Pretty nice, but not among my favourites.
",5
6103,"A good beer.  Not quite what I expected after having read about it for the last 6 months in the forum and finally tasting it.  Fruitier than expected.  A very pronouned fruity scent with a hint of orange?  Very nice after taste feeling on the tongue.  Havent had many beers of this style but I can definently see myself becoming a fan.
",5
6104,"
",5
6105,"Not bad, but have to agree with the previous rater, a little too much of everything here.  Maybe this one is an acquired taste?
",5
6106,"A minor dissapointment every time Ive tasted it. Maybe my expectations have been too high? Its better than most brews, of course, but theres a bit too little of everything in it.
",1
6107,"(Chimay Premire in corked 75 cl. bottle)	Herby-malty nose with depth.	White head of foam, fading but with medium consistancy, some cloudiness (yeast in suspension, bottle had been laid down), dark amber color, little fizz.	Herby-malty taste, with volume, good foam in the mouth, some licorice, very good medium-intense herbaceous finish without bitterness nor stickyness.	This is very good, tastes like artisanal (as against industrail).  The lower third of the bottle was full of floating yeast cells, turned it into a creamy rich tasting ..food.. brew, very good indeed.  My score is no doubt conservative.
",5
6108,"Reminds quite a bit of wine. Very fruity.
",5
6109,"UPDATED: JUL 25, 2003 Call me silly, but this is my preferred Chimay. I find it the most complex on the palate and the most varied as it warms. It also offers one of these 'plus fours' ala Shulgin more often than any other beer for me. Unbeatable creamy mousse over an amber-brown chalice. A unique well-blended harmony of malt and hops -- perfume, tobacco, tart, alcohol pepper, creamy feel and very easy mild bitter finish.
",5
6110,"Its not as intense as the blue, but smoother
",5
6111,"Very simlar to Chimay Blue but with a milder aroma and less intoxicating. Very fruity flavour.
",5
6112,"Malty testy aroma.  Noticeable hop flavor and dryer than Chimay Blue though still sweet.  Smoothest of the Chimays; delicious.
",5
6113,"UPDATED: JUN 13, 2004 Light colored head. The bottle is simple and understated.  Excellent honey and apple aroma and flavor.  This goes down very smooth and leaves a smile on your face.. :-)
",5
6114,"I was expecting something else but this one isnt as good as I thought but nice nontheless.  A bit bitter for my taste in the end.  Long lasting aftertaste with a hint of coffie. Nice with a good meal.
",5
6115,"Can it get any better than this??
",5
6116,"Its Chimay Red.  What else can you say?  Strong, full, yeasty, delicious, glorious.
",5
6117,"I find the smooth hoppy flavors very irresistible...I keep coming back to this bottle several times a month.  What can I say, say no more!
",5
6118,"My favorite of the three
",5
6119,"UPDATED: FEB 12, 2004 the last couple of times i've had this it's been disappointing. newish bottles of this aren't paricularly complex, the stewed pear in spices aroma and luscious texture are the main redeeming qualities
",1
6120,"A cut above the White.
",5
6121,"Sensational, the best Beer ive tasted so far, brilliant
",5
6122,"Not as full as the blue, but a fully refined Ale. Very distinctive Chimay fruitiness. Excellent stuff.
",5
6123,"Suprising
",5
6124,"lovely colour nice taste
",5
6125,"Wow.  This is an excellent beer.  Light brown head, dark copper appearance and a taste that creeps up and explodes.  As another person said, this fine Belgian brew gets better as it slightly warms up in the glass.  A veritable taste sensation.  Time to try the white and blue now.  Yum.
",5
6126,"One of the great beers	smooth but not a dnse as the Blue.	unmistakable yeasty Chimay taste
",5
6127,"A most noble brew deserving of our highest respect.. Throatwarming and yeasty...
",5
6128,"I was expecting this not to be too good.  I figured this was some rooty-tooty beerthat snobs enjoyed.  I was wrong.  What a great beer.
",1
6129,"Not as good as the Blue, IMO. Nevertheless an excellent, heavy beer. If youve had any variety of Chimay before you will recognize the flavor immediately. The Red tastes more reasonable than the Blue in terms of yeast and texture.
",5
6130,"This is truly the most beautiful beer I have seen.  Deep milky copper/bronze color with a fluffy eggshell colored head.  The aroma and flavor were dominated by yeast with malt flavors coming out as it warmed.  Great body and a delight to drink although I prefer the Bleu.
",5
6131,"UPDATED: AUG 26, 2007 Dark copper-coloured beer. Smells good, nice carbonation. I thought the blue was a little bit better, but the white cant cope with this excellent brune!
",5
6132,"Great beer overall. As it warms, it gives off an incredible array of aromas and tastes.
",5
6133,"My favorite of the Chimays as well. Has a great depth of flavor without being overpowering. Cloistered rooms, even a suggestion of fruit, maybe apples. Lots of memories in this bottle for me.
",5
6134,"
",5
6135,"strange, but not bad, aroma, with as sharp after taste
",5
6136,"
",5
6137,"Deep, dark copper color with a short lived foamy head.  Smooth, fruity overtones with a slightly bitter finish mellowing, again, into a refreshing fruity aftertaste.
",5
6138,"ahhhh!  a great beer!  mastered and excellent!  superb!	clean taste, nice alcohol %!
",5
6139,"I found the nose a bit odd--kind of smelly-sneaker like--but this didnt really detract from this great beer. Very fruity, with a slight bitterness and well-balanced spice flavors. The flavor of alcohol was strong, but not overpowering.
",5
6140,"Excellent brown color, almost copper, with a nice frothy head. Less complex than other trappists and slightly bland (comparatively), however this makes it much easier to drink. I didnt have to spend my time deciphering its many flavors and was able to enjoy the whole bottle. Easy to drink and very smooth. A slight bitterness develops with warmth, building to a sharp finish. Very nice.
",5
6141,"I actually like this better than the bleu.  Alcohol is less prevalent, both in taste and aroma, allowing a more fruity, maltiness to shine through.  Beautiful brown, muddy appearance, with a creamy white head.  Unfortunately, carbonation robs this beer of the smoothness that would make it near perfect. Regardless, this is a great beer.
",5
6142,"My dad said this was an excellent beer. This is a cloudy muddy brown in color. I really noticed the aroma as I tasted it, an interesting complex smell I liked. I really noticed the complexity of the taste in the first couple of tastes. Im no expert so I cant tell what it was. But the more I drank, the less distinguished these flavors became. By the middle of the beer, it seemed like an decent ordinary beer. But I realized as I was finishing, this was tasty and interesting. All in all, a good beer but not the best Ive had.
",5
6143,"This is a very unique beer.    Warmly alcoholic and delightful to behold.   The color was very interesting.    While not my favorite Belgium this is certainly worthy.   It has an interesting fruitiness and a terrific aroma.

6148,"UPDATED: JAN 25, 2003 Cloudy red, foamy white head that dissipitates rather quickly.  Yeast and a little fruit in the nose.  Spritzy and yeasty with a complex maltiness.  Finishes lightly bitter.  Could be a better beer, too much CO2.  The least of the trappists.

6152,"UPDATED: FEB 2, 2004 cloudy reddish-brown colour with a big creamy head, malt and haye aroma with notes of banana, creamy mouthfeel, medium-bodied, oily with a touch of acidity, slightly overcarbonated, dry and moderately malty finish - unremarkable; this is just the shadow of this was before:  this stuff is now highly overrated !
",1
6153,"Beautiful reddish-caramel color with a smooth fruity aroma. Warms all the way down with alcohol reminder in your mouth. Its never overwhelming with just the right amount flavor and bitterness. Spicey sweetness builds the more you drink with none of the cidery notes that the white label carries. This is truly the Champagne of Beers. Those monks out did themselves!
",5
6154,"Dark coppery, cloudy color, with a moderately foamy head which lasts.  Big malt/spice nose.  Had a strong flavor, most of which were hard for me to put my finger on.  Spice, cider, fruity, with developing bitterness.  Hopefully someday Il find a 750 to see if there are differences.

6167,"UPDATED: JAN 8, 2006 Cloudy light brown (slight amber accent) with bone-coloured head.  Aroma of raisin bread (candi sugar), brown sugar, plums, and a little nuttiness.  Flavour starts sweet (apple pie, plum, raisin), picks up a bit of demerara accent, then turns more yeasty with a bit of dustiness and astringency late.  Alcohol comes in at the end to dry it up.

6173,"UPDATED: DEC 10, 2004 This is my original rating corresponding to a 4.8 score and a somewhat naive palate: A nearly flawless beer.  One of my favorites of all time.	Appropriately cloudy and brownish red.	Fruity and spicy aroma.	Rich flavor - hints of apple cider	and other fruitiness.  	New rating, despite the warnings that this beer is on the decline it still has very far to go before it declines even into the ""merely good"" range.  A really nice combination of fruitiness with a dash of spicy phenols and a sourdough yeasty finish, very well balanced and even in the mouth.  Everything mixes well, nothing stands out, nothing is missing.  A bit fizzy.  It may not be a true 4.8 but its still one of the worlds great beers.
",5
6174,"750ml bottle poured into a goblet. Red/brown and cloudy with small disappearing head. Aroma is raisins, spice, plum, citrus, malt.

6193,"Very good, quite similar to the blue other than alcohol content and milder taste.  Very good, silky, rich dark robust flavor, complex taste that obviously took some time to perfect. Awesome overall, love the dark rich sweet flavor with a hint of spiceiness on the aftertaste. The tongue is covered in delicious dark beer then subsides and then you drink another. 	The blue and red are a favorite for cooking savory dishes and certain cheeses.

",5
6200,"Bottle pours murky brown with a tan head. Aroma is fruity and somewhat spicy, showing notes of apricot, fig, banana, cocoa, and clove.  Flavor shows the same with the bread/caramel influence begining to show and providing the underlying malt influence.  Overall body is light to moderate.

6201,"Transcription of an old BA review from 01-16-2010, with scores adjusted to RB scale. Will re-rate...someday.		330 ml into Chimay chalice. BB says 2013.	The pouring results in long-lived light tan head atop of hazy coppery fluid with reddish depth. Head slowly dies out until a thin soapy film is all what is left. Malty (not sweet!) aroma, unburnt toast, raisins, hint of plum and perfumy almost rose-like alcohol.The flavor profile is malty although far less sweet than expected - more alike of bitter caramel, with raisins, toasty bread crust bitterness and soft alcohol leading into dry finish. As with Chimay White the individual characteristics are somehow indecisive and I cant easily pinpoint at any although they are clearly delimited. However, the beer is very well balanced and refined with individual flavors/aromas in tune with each other. Medium bodied, medium carbonated. This dubbel is not nearly as fruity as that of Achel or Westmalle but it was the red friar that once introduced me into Trappist ale world and ignited my curiosity about other monastic brews, so Chimay Red , I owe you so much.
",5
6202,"Outstanding!  Pours dark, reddish - brown color.  Off-white head with nice lacings.  Sweet aroma.  Taste is sweet with a slight bitterness, some dark fruits.  Medium carbonation.  Slightly bitter aftertaste.  Medium body.  Outstanding brew.  Not overly filling, which I like in a dubbel.  Very easy to drink.  Probably my favorite beer.

6203,"Poured dark copper with no real head tasted caramel bread and yeast very good beer but not my favorite chimay butn good non the less
",5
6204,"Bottle, gusher. Brown/red color with a tan colored head (about two fingers) which unfortunately almost immediately disappears. Very little lacing. It starts out cloudy, a bit like murky water. Subtle aroma, which oddly reminds me of autumn leaves and dried fruit. Taste is soft bitter, combined with some sweetness like sugarcane. Feels a little bit thin in the mouth, light-medium body and a nice soft carbonation which fills your mouth; nice. Quite a long finish which brings some more flavors, but leaves me thinking of something slightly oxidized. I like this kind of carbonation, but overall I cannot see whats so great about it, I prefer other dubbels.

6205,"foamy, malty and sweet with caramel and dried mostly dark fruits. Balanced with some new fruit and spice including licorice and a bitter tinge of hop. Moderate slick sweet body that is a bit milky and completes an impressive overall package.
",5
6206,"When opening theres an overspill from the yeast surely. Lovely red colour and creamy head. Malty aroma. Taste is quite brash and lacking in hoppy bitterness, but the flavours grew on me and were quite satisfying by the end of the glass. Decent trappist ale.
",5
6207,"330ml bottle from SAQ. drank from trappiste glass. pours a murky reddish brown that holds a thin white foamy head. aroma is fruity, mostly plum and apricot. taste is wonderfully yeasty. lots of complex fruity flavours going on. silky on the palate and full bodied, lots of carbonation. fantastic beer.
",5
6208,"Bottle.  Red brown pour with nice head.  Brown sugar, bread, coffee, cereal, liquerish, flower, tangy charbonation and some bitterness.  A fuller body would have made this a better balanced beer.  Pretty good beer.

6209,"Poured into a snifter. Appearance is a murky brown with a thin offwhite head that dissipates pretty quickly. Goods lacing. Aroma is malts and dried fruits. Taste is malty with hints of nuts and caramel. Super creamy feel on the tongue. This beer is very nice and I am glad to make it my first rated dubbel.
",5
6210,"It pours a almost see-through nut brown.	Smell with fresh, almost tropical fruit.  Good malt focus.	It got a beautiful mouthfeel, with a tight foam. Good concentration with nuts, raisin and almost a milkchocolat taste. A long aftertaste, but it falls alittle, and are not very concentrated in the end. A good beer, non the less!
",5
6211,"Beautiful copper amber pour with a generous tan head. Aromas of apricots. plums grapes and the signature Belgium yeast esters. It is essential to use a goblet, chalace or tulip for maximum enjoyment of its intricate aromas. The full flavors of this brew come alive slightly below  50 degrees. Tastes of dried fruits with  overtones of semisweet candied sugar. A hint of bitterness other than from the usual hop flavors. A well balanced solid choice anytime.

",5
6215,"750 ml corked and caged. 	Murky copper, with a rocky tan head. Head settles quickly leaving delicate lacing behind.	Aroma is light fruit and yeast.	Flavor is much like the aroma, very light fruit, some yeast, light bittering.	Mildly dry finish.
",1
6216,"A very dark ""reddish"" murky brown color with big head that goes to lacing which sticks around forever. Light bubbly carbonation. Aroma of sweet prune. Flavor is very much sweet plum/prune with lots of yeasty dark fruit esters. I let it warm a while. It gets very smooth indeed, as described. I think it needs a little more ""bite"", something to hook it on the back side. Otherwise, this is a super drinkable world classic.
",5
6217,"Looks excellent, although slightly disappointing as its not as good as I thought it would be, nice red/brown colour with a malty taste. Quite a strong alcohol content so best drunk in moderation
",5
6218,"UPDATED: DEC 28, 2011 Small bottle. Rusty brown body, good head. Hoppy aroma. Taste is initially sweet with caramel and prunes. Delicate and dry bitter finish. Very good but Bleue has even bigger taste.
",5
6219,"Thick and dark brown with lingering lacing head. Fruity and caramel, but well balanced with hops. Very very nice
",5
6220,"A blast of fruit hits your nose as you are pouring this, apricot, peach, raspberry.  It smells a bit boozy, you can feel the warmth of the ethanol.  Beautiful copper red appearance with a creamy head, no lacing.  Taste is plum, apricot, slight banana, yeast nuttiness, balanced by a soft sweetness and mild bitterness.  This is a very well balanced brew, body is medium, texture creamy and slick, lively carbonation, gentle finish.  I very pleased with this, I think it is equal to the Blue.
",5
6221,"Really I think some people expect Belgium beers to be strong and off putting, and some are. This beer is light and delicate. It really draws you in with its subtlety. An easy drinking masterpiece. The kind of beer that if you had to choose one beer that  you would drink the rest of your life, you would choose this. Dark fruits in the flavor. Prunes, figs and raisins. The mild smoothness and complexity are superb. Tingly carbonation that lifts a very faint cinnamon and clove in the background. The more you drink it the more you discover its perfection.
",5
6222,"Served into a Westmalle chalice		A: Brown reddish with a beige frothy head, some visible carbonation, small beige lace.		S: Ripe fruits, raisins, brown sugar, spices, creamy smell (cant actually explain it), hops.		T: First time I had it tasted like thanksgiving to me I guess it was the spices, sweet at first then giving way for the delicious bitterness, the alcohol it very well masked, kind of light fell , the carbonation its very present.		Overall its a very delicious beer in my book. Been going back to this one a couple of times, its widely available here in Barcelona so its no problem to have it anytime.
",5
6223,"0.5L bottle. Cloudy red/brown color - leaves no lacing while the head dissipates quickly. Smells of a heavy fruit (peach, apricot) but not intense. The taste is somehow disappointing for a beer carrying a Trappistes label. Part sour, part bitter, a good mouth feel without any defining flavor outside of the aromatic fruit. The aftertaste continues the trend. I just wish there was more.

6224,"Bottle. deep red  / tawny port color. dense thick head with a sweet malt in the nose. Mustsy, rich and chewy. Rich and creamy with a tad bit of spiceyness..A bit furuity and a sweet alcohol finish..Great dubbel

6225,"Pours medium brown with a lot of sediment and a medium sized light brown head. Nose is moderately strong and very brown-sugary and malty with a touch of yeast and alcohol.

6236,"33cl bottle. In some respects, the description above is true. It does have a coppery colour and a creamy head.

6242,"Really? This beer lacked taste, aroma......   Very extremely subtle flavors...... what is all this fuss about chimay???? I still need to try chimay blue. This beer was better than budweiser, but really? Is this really a craft beer?  nothing special. A VERY AVERAGE BEER. Did i get a bad batch? practically water.
",1
6243,"I am more disappointed than I can say. I had heard so much about Chimay (red or blue label) and expected far more than I received. Almost no bitterness with a strangely sour sweet flavor. Colors decent (though minimal head), but flavor leaves much to be desired for a trappist beer. Almost watery mouthfeel. Wtf, guys?
",1
6244,"Pours a deep deep cherry red, with a white creamy head that lingers for most of the drink. Nose is delightfully fruity, but mostly of plums, I would reckon. The taste confirms the fruity aromas with a singular blend of plums, apricot, and cherry. Quite malty with just enough hop bitterness to make the whole thing really refreshing.  Low carbonation so its nice and velvety on the tongue. Finish is a bit astringent but doesnt linger long and is somewhat expected from the style. Very smooth, very fruity, very awesome.

6245,"If you havent tried any of the Chimay beers, than WTF are you doin on Ratebeer???
",5
6246,"I cant add anything that hasnt been said in the 2,100 other reviews for this excellent beer, save that it might be the most drinkable beer I have ever encountered.

6248,"Pours murky brown with a large lasting head.	Nose shows golden syrup and brown sugar along with spicy phenolic yeast and some light fruity esters.	Flavours are very doughy (overwhelmingly) with more spicy yeast and alcohol.	Carbonation is low, especially for the style. Probably the first time Ive said a Belgian doesnt have enough carbonation actually.
",1
6249,"A straightforward ale.  Very malty, slightly sweet start, smooth mouthfeel, pleasant finish.		This beer tasted much more ""commercial"" than I was expecting.  I guess I expected a more robust, raw ale from monks.
",5
6250,"Used to drink this at the Dubliner in the Old Market in Omaha back in the day so I have a certain nostalgia for Chimay because  for me this was my first forays into what beer could be besides american lagers.

6263,"(11.2 oz bottle).  Pours red-copper color with off-white head and yeast floaties (didnt pour the traditional way-just poured the entire bottle).  Wonderful aroma of dried cherries, banana, and some alcohol.  Taste is mildly sweet with a hint of sourness.  Unlike the white cap, the hops are less noticeable.  Medium bodied and somewhat thin and oily.  carbonation is flat and finish is quite smooth.  This is my least favorite Chimay and dubbels in general are not my favorite, but I did enjoy this beer.  Its not the best Trappist beer or dubbel around, but its a good beer nevertheless.

6264,"Another fine beer from Chimay.  Unbelievable flavor.  Just a hint of bite but not enough to lock up your jaw on the first taste.  Drank this while sitting on the back porch swing on a warm summer evening.  Went down smooth and did not feel the buzz until I stood up!

6285,"Bottle.		A - Lighter, honey chestnut brown with some orangish hues. Fairly large, foamy, bubbly white head with average retention and a nice thin bubbly layer of lace.		S - Strong caramel and bready malt aroma. With a sweet toasted aroma and some nuttiness. Some light aroma of raisin and plum. Some spiced aroma is present too with cinnamon, some clove, and other spices. This is a bit lighter than what I expected, but it is nice none the less. A sweet, dark, toasted bread aroma.		T - Similar to the nose. A sweet, dark bready malt taste provides for the base and a lot of the flavor. Mid sip to the finish some fruitiness comes out with raisin and plum being the strongest with it being on the lighter side of a dark fruit flavor. Some spice, cinnamon and clove, along with a hint of bubblegum also come out. Like the aroma, it reminded me of a sweet dark bread with some pieces of fruit in it.		M - On the lighter side of medium body with average carbonation. A little watery, especially for the style, but pretty smooth.		D - Fairly complex and well balanced, but has a subtlety for the style in that it isnt overly powerful. All this makes for a pretty easy to drink beer. The flavor is good, but not strong or overpowering on the palate.		Notes: Vintage 2009. This was a bit lighter and subtler Dubbel. The flavors were enjoyable even though it didnt taste like other Dubbels I have had. Overall it was an enjoyable beer that I would gladly drink again. It didnt blow me away, but it was somewhat unique.

6296,"UPDATED: MAY 20, 2010 Pours a ruby red brew with a hint of brown. Big bubbles in the foam, and big bubbles settle on the bottom of the glass. Im drinking it from a large win glass, since thats the closest thing I have to a trappist glass. This is also my first trappist beer. 	Taste reminds me of Leffe Blonde, a fruity bubblegumy aroma which glides into a mix of almonds, marzipan and ... hm, what is that other stuff? I dont know, but I like it! 	update 2010-05-20: Im trying another bottle - this time an older one. Batch L09-648, best before end 2013. (The previous tasting was from a bottle from 2010, best before 2014). Its pretty much like the newer one in most aspects, but seems a bit more balanced to me. Its got a tiny sting to it, and and overall better balance between bitter and sweet. This leads me to think that this beer does well with a year or so on bottle before drinking it. But hey, Im no expert! I just like this beer! Cant wait to try other Chimay/trappist beers! Btw, it works well paired with a taste I love, Parmesan cheese.

Not as much retention as I thought it would be, and hardly any lace. Spices and Belgian yeast aromas, but lighter then Unibroues competition. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Smooth nutty start with some mild bitterness and a clean aftertaste. Some spices, but flavour is not overpowering, quite light actually. Found some fruit as well, like some pear and slight apple. Expected more from this brew, but still a very good start for someone who has not tried a trappist beer. Still, the white cap is my favorite of the Chimays.

The taste is again mildly sweet, balanced with clean bitter hops and a little yeasty sour.  	The fairly high carb creates a lingering head but without a lot of lacing, and also some truly satisfying belches.  More strikingly, it creates a mouthfeel that is similar to champagne bubbles dancing across your tongue that enhances an underlying and (I hate to say) delightful pepperiness.	This is a sentimental favorite.  Chimay Red is the beer that convinced me that there really is more out there and had to be my first rating.  I dont know if there will be many more ratings, but there will be many more beers.  Thanks to all of the hardworking monks at Scourmont Abbey!

6308,"When aging beer, there is always a little bit of Russian roulette involved. While there are certain standards and guidelines to assist one on their path of building a beer cellar, risk is always an enjoyable factor; the mystery and challenge of aging a beer to its peak of supping perfection. The reward is beyond words and the thrill is one of lifes best. Chimay is a premier Trappist brewery in Belgium, offering 3 sublime beers to the unworthy masses. First and foremost is their Premier, or Red, as it is sometimes referred to. Chimay themselves recommend enjoy Premier as fresh as possible; within a year, so it was a delightful surprise when popping the cork on my bottle at home to discover I was about to indulge on a vintage 2007 bottle. Glory days are here again.			Hazy ruby and blood-orange depths fill my glass thick and full. A bit hazier than usual, an attribute I would pin on her age. A gentle khaki head settles slowly into a puffy layer of foam which makes way for a succulent nose of sweet honey-glazed dessert breads soaked in rum and brandy. Plums, black grapes, red pears, red licorice, red apples, and ripe apricots bring a cornucopia of tropical and succulent fall fruits to life. Cinnamon sticks sprinkle spice unto her fruity bouquet while candied fruits and apple juice mingle atop moist rye bread and fruitcake. Her nose lacks a crisp bite but more than makes up for it in softness which has melded together in exquisite ripeness. Sufficiently impressed with her nose, those hazy luscious depths are calling my name; naturally I answer. Sweet, bready, rummy, fruity, spiced, and just darn tasty. Slightly mouthcoating, honey and maple esters stick to my lips and sides of cheeks while I bite into red apples, pears, plums, black grapes, and apricots, their skins bursting with a crunch, juices trailing down the sides of my mouth. Smackerific. Cinnamon sticks and rum soaked rye breads mingle together in each meaty quaff while the middle of her palate slowly dries mine. Not overly dry; just enough to induce my thirst and encourage further quaffing indulgence. Dry wood tickles the back of my throat while cinnamon, rum, and brandy spice my breath and warm my chest. Melting in her boozy warmth are all her juicy meaty fruity delights. Exquisitely rich, sweet, fruity, warm, and ending with a dry spiced flourish; I must say I enjoy her with some age a bit more than fresh, though for a totally different set of reasons.			Chimay never fails to please and sometimes even surprise. While I wouldnt age the Premier as long as I would their Grand Reserve, by all means bring home a few bottles. Enjoy one fresh, but then save the others for later supping in whatever randomly timed intervals you so please.

6310,"330 mL bottle from the LCBO, poured in a branded Trappist glass. Pours cloudy copper-brown with a tall, frothy tan head. A few particles of sediment made their way out of the bottle.

Notes of candied fruit and medium-roasted caramel malts. Finish is long and sweet with a hint of nutmeg. On the palate, medium in body and ultra-smooth in texture. Well-carbonated with fine bubbles.

Taste begins with toasted caramel malts and cloves followed by a strong, doughy spiced yeast presence. It has a smooth and dry finish with some hints of brown sugar and rum. Theres a slightly bitter clove aftertaste. Smooth and tasty with a relatively low ABV for a Belgian.

6315,"11,95$ at Bires et Compagnie in Terrebonne (and the boss e-mailed me he was hurt by my rating of his bar...).  Interesting, well-done and quality stuff but a little bland: very discreet sweetness, discreet fruityness, discreet bitterness.

6318,"a nice short bottle enjoyed in my chimay glass. Perfect red and orange color and thin head resting in a wide brimmed glass. The aroma was sweet and yeasty. Sort of dried apricot and white peach along with a little spice and bread from the yeast esters. Such a silky mouth feel along with the sweetness makes ones feel as if he is drinking a perfume. Ends in a slightest bitter finish.
",5
6319,"Murky brown with a hint of red to it.  The aroma is rich and musty with redcurrants and salty crackers.  In the mouth there is a burst of rich sweetness which then turns to more roasty characters and a sticky caramel yeastiness. 		I drank this alongside the Ham Cooked in Coke and Stout from Appetite for Ale and it was excellent bringing a frutiness to cut through the fatty pork.  I found the sweet glaze gave it a touch too much of a bitterness in the finish though. Maybe there is a better dish to pair with (though they recommended it in the book.)

6323,"My least favorite of the three, and still it is great beer.  Bottle to Trappist glass.  Pours dark amber with white head that does not last as long as its cousins.  I get caramel, coffee and chocolate malt.  Not as sweet as the cousins either, and has an earthy quality that is like a truffle.  Creamy in the mouth.  How can anyone complain about a beer like this?
",5
6324,"From a metric 12 oz into a snifter.  Pours a caramel red with lots of fuzzy head.  Head disappears quickly, leaving no lacing.  Smell is of caramel, red wine grapes and apricot.   Mouthfeel is medium to thick but somewhat light and smooth as well.  Probably from the dryness of the yeast.  Taste is very winey and yeasty.  Not too sweet at all.  Its the gold standard of belgians and I can understand why.  Well worth a try.
",5
6325,"Although not quite as heavy as its cousins, Chimay Blanche and Bleu, the Rouge is a very tasty abbey dubbel. Like most dubbels, its malty and full-bodied, but unlike most of them it has a particularly yeasty flavor. Taste is of brown sugar, as brown as the brew itself when it hits the glass. A moderate, off-white topping gives of a faint scent of clove. This is a very nice beer; light enough to go with most foods or to be drunk rather easily, beefy enough to weigh in with the pros.

6330,"We all know wine snobs exist but beer snobs have been gaining some serious ground over the last decade or two. Ive never had to put a wine snob in their place, but if I did Id probably use the entire Chimay line (and all the authentic trappist beers for that matter) as an example of beer craftsmanship.Chimay Red Premiere is a great starter beer for the wine-drinker looking for a comparable beer. Its got all the makings of a versatile red wine: strong aroma and palate, fruity taste without the bitterness, and the body to match. Pedestrian drinkers might find it a bit intimidating, but in reality its actually not as uppity as one might assume.Chimay beers are sold in either 330ml capped or crowned bottles or 750ml corked bottles, and there is a distinct difference between the two. I was able to drink both versions but found the corked beer to be a bit superior. Ill discuss the differences throughout this review as applicable.POUR, COLOR AND AROMAIf poured from a 750ml bottle, there is quite a lot of kickback (which is due to the shape of the bottle and is completely normal). Out of a stubby, reverse funnel-shaped 330ml bottle, the beer pours much smoother.The body is a dark, murky shade of maroon or rusty brown, almost like iced tea. There is noticeable sediment due to the fact this is a bottle-conditioned beer which means the yeast is still at work even after the brewing process. If poured into an official Chimay glass (or a red wine glass or similar glass), the beer produces a fairly small layer of off-white, foamy head. It lingers for quite a while but will eventually disappear completely and leave no lacing.I noticed two different aromas. The corked bottle is much lighter in the nose with a sweet, fruity, malty scent. It indicates a lively palate. The crowned bottle is reminiscent of red wine with a sour, dry nose. The presence of alcohol is well-concealed by both versions.TASTEUpon my first taste of Chimay Red I was immediately reminded of a German-style doppelbock. Considering that this is a Belgian dubbel, it isnt surprising the styles are so similar (even though one is a lager and one is an ale).In the case of the 750ml corked bottle, the beer has a rich, malty character complimented by the taste of dark fruits (i.e. plum, raisin, fig). The taste is sweeter than I was expecting, almost sugary. The backend is slightly dry but the alcohol is never noticeable. Its tasty, to be sure, but its surprisingly mild.With the 330ml capped bottle I was immediately reminded of a red wine as soon as it hit my tongue. This version is drier and rather sour with a distinct grape-like taste. Interestingly, the finish is even sweeter with a candy apple-like taste. I dont think caramel malts are used in this beer but I did notice a caramel-like sweetness on the finish, although it dries out rather quickly. The taste is a little more intense here, but it seems more to-the-point whereas the corked version takes a roundabout path.FINISHBottle-conditioned beers tend to be more highly carbonated than other brews. The corked edition of Chimay Red has a slightly flat, thin, watery mouthfeel. There is definitely carbonation action present, but its a completely different type compared to that found in a macro lager. It goes down extremely smooth and is not a challenge to drink whatsoever.With the smaller bottle the finish was more or less the same, but with a seemingly more intense mouthfeel. The finish, while sweet, also leaves a dry, almost sour aftertaste and warms as it goes down. Its just about as smooth as its big brother, and certainly easier to drink than red wine.BODYI probably wouldnt consider a beer with an alcohol content of 7% ABV to be a big beer, although I think Chimays reputation might supersede its actual potency. In other words, Red Premiere drinks like a heavy beer because we assume it is one. This is ironic because the beer does not have a boozy taste to it unless allowed to warm to near room temperature. The drinker is unlikely to immediately feel the effects of the alcohol, but it will make its presence known in the end.FINAL THOUGHTSThe Chimay beers are roundly regarded as some of the best brews on the planet and for a beer critic to rate them at anything less than the best is probably consider blasphemy. While I would say I really enjoyed both versions of the beer I cant quite rate either versions among the best of the best. Despite the fact the palate to both beers is not as intense as one might expect, Id still consider Chimay Red Premiere to be an acquired taste. I highly recommend trying it, if only to see how well a beer can work as a wine substitute.NOTE: Watch the video versions of this review here:750ml corked version:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba0G5lg_bY4330ml capped version:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbc_BZXr-Hw

6331,"750 mL bottle pours murky mahogany with a nice, fizzy, khaki head.  Carbonation seems really active, but the head doesnt last; nice lacing.  Sweet, malty aroma with raisins taking the forefront; dates, red apples, pear, red grapes, slight spice.  Very similar in the taste: apples and grapes make up the primary flavor for me.  Bready malts are evident with clove and other spices coming through.  Finishes with brown sugar, spice, and a slight boozy touch.  Medium bodied with a frothy mouthfeel and a medium level of carbonation.  Despite being a bit thin, I feel the rating is appropriate mostly in part to its impeccable balance.  The tastes all compliment each other very well with nothing standing out too much or too little.  This leads to a very easy to drink, great brew.

6332,"750ml bottle. Rich mahogany hue with short lasting brindle (tan with flecks of various browns) foamy head fully diminishing, murky body with a thick density of medium sized particles. Moderate to heavy malty aromas - caramel, Maltexo, toffee, bread, with a plethora of complex fruity and spicy aromas - vinous, stone-fruit, banana, cloves, and some yeasty aromas - dough. Taste is heavy sweet, some mild bitterness makes a brief appearance then the sweetness dominates again with a long duration. Body is medium, texture is oily almost syrupy, carbonation is mostly lively leaving a tingly tongue, pleasant warming alcoholic finish. 	This was a really nice beer but may have suffered from high (97th percentile) expectations. Didnt quite live up to the hype for me. Still very enjoyable though.

6333,"Dark pour from bottle.  Excellent balance of malt, hops, and light fruit taste.  Medium abv, goes great with a nice steak.  Typical strong offering from the folks at Chimay.  Excellent!

6334,"UPDATED: DEC 24, 2010 Bottle. Wonderful hoppy characterisitics. Fruity and spicy nose. Wonderful creamy texture, lightly sweet with fruity and spicy flavors, with dry and bitter finish. Long on the tongue. Nice complexity. Rich color and a great pour in the glass.

6335,"Great beer.  To get the full experience let it warm up a bit.  After pulling it from the refrigerator I let it sit for a 15 minutes and it really adds to the flavor.  The color is a dark, almost burnt orange.  There is not much aroma, but the taste is floral and smooth.

6336,"Really sharp and utterly dry Trappist. Not very much to my liking. Foamed a lot from the bottle, very dark color but taste is not for me. Gladly, the aftertaste is gone like a gust of wind. Not my favorite.

6337,"750mL bottle.  Pours a clear reddish brown with a thick and reasonably persistent head.  Aromas of yeast and malt.  Mild fruity flavour, strong malt, medium sweetness, slight sourness.  Medium bodied, lively carbonation, smooth with a slight bitter finish.

6338,"In bottle; pours a red/brown cloudly color. Aroma was not great, might of been the glass it was poured into. taste was good, almost too mild in body though. Very smooth and very easy drinking. I good beer, but I prefer the Blue

6339,"Very drinkable beer. Rich fruity flavors and aromas. But still i prefer the blue Chimay.

6340,"UPDATED: JUN 12, 2010 Cloudy brown pour, medium soapy-creamyish head, slightly tanned.	Aroma of old beer, fruits, caramel, oak.	Dare I say somewhat thin flavour and mouthfeel, some spices.	Ok beer, but I not a fan.

6344,"A really good beer as I can drink more of, have a lovely aroma and is slightly cloudy orange in it.
",5
6345,"An excellent Belgian Strong, but not as good as the Chimay Blue. Aroma is malty and delicious... smells of doughy bread. Appearance is a crimson brown that is crystal clear with a nice head that leaves good lacing. Taste and palate is smooth and creamy, malty and delcious. Slightly bitter but mostly sweet through the finish that stays with you but is not overly long. A wonderful step in the direction of the Blue.
",5
6346,"Bottle - Pours dark copper with an off white head. Smells yeasty with some light spice (cloves, nutmeg) and a nice, subtly sweet breadiness. The taste is lightly spiced bread, a touch of honey sweetness, and a dry, yeasty finish. Smooth, balanced, and wonderful, this is my favorite between Chimay White and Blue. I find the other two to be too bitter and sharp, but this is pure silk.
",5
6347,"one of my favorite belgians. pours rich brown with medium white head. aromas are roasted caramel malts, sugars, rich red fruits, leather. drinks with tons of light caramel malt and sweet sugar with a leather almost smokey note to it and nice banana and bread yeast. fantastic
",5
6348,"75 cl bottle shared. Pours cloudy-red coloured with a big head. Some initial sharp bitter citrus flavour with a slight taste of caramel in the back ground. Over all the red does not meet the hype, it tastes good, but there are better Belgian Ales to be had.

6349,"UPDATED: JUL 22, 2010 (bottle) cloudy reddish brown with tall thick head; aroma of bread, cereal, bit of fruit; lightly bitter flavour with some mineral aspect; can not say I particularly liked it
",1
6350,"Pours a cloudy coppery brown with a slight tan head.  Fades to moderately thick lacing.  The nose is too subtle for me to effectively describe, what little I get is reminscent of dark fruits.		Full mouthfeel, nice and crisp, the initial sweetness fades to a slightly metallic aftertaste.		Overall its not bad, but despite its authenticity and background its not even close to becoming my favorite in this style.

6351,"Bottle. Pours a ruby red/brownish beer with a good head. Dark fruits and brown sugar in the aroma. Taste is really good. Full mouthfeel with bitter notes. Liked this great dubbel.
",5
6352,"Pours a murky, brown-red colored body with an inch thick, creamy and frothy, off-white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice. The caramel malty sweetness is clearly present, but comes off as thinner rather than fat. There is also a light bread to the malts. Lots of yeast with a light spice and some vinous characteristics. There is a good deal of citric fruits, apricots, grapes, and some raisin. Flavor is similar, not quite as nice as the aroma in my opinion.  Some thinner caramels and a little more noticeable toffee flavor. Lots of yeast and somewhat spicy with more of a darker fruit flavor, but still a good deal of lighter colored fruits. Finishes somewhat vinous with a light bitterness, a bit thin, and fairly dry with a moderate aftertaste. Medium carbonation and body. Overall, a nice dubbel. Not exceptional, but consistently reliable. Very drinkable and well made.
",5
6353,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2011 Nice opaque, amber hue. Sweet and hoppy. Good fizz for a nice mouthfeel. A real quality ale.

6354,"The commercial description is pretty right on. This is probably my favorite of the Chimay beers. This is full of flavor but not overbearingly so. Had from bottle with a chicken dish, and it was awesome.

6355,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2010 Poured a dark reddish orange/brown with a medium off-white head. The aroma and taste is a mix of caramel malts, dried fruits, mild spice, brown sugar. Medium body, good depth & balance, medium carbonation. Overall: very good.

6357,"Pours brown with a big off white head.  The head only lasted a little bit on this one.  Aroma had a big caramel and spicy hop note.  Flavor was much of the same,  but it had some woody cork flavors,  spicy hops,  caramel,  toffee,  and lots of fruit qualities.  Finishes mildly bitter, dry, with quite a bit of carbonation.  I wish it wouldnt have taken me so long to try this,  very good.

6358,"33cl bottle. Deep red brown with nice cream head. Sweet fruit on the nose. Candy sugar on the tongue with a delicious hap bitterness. Dried raisiny fruit. This was delicious.

6359,"Pours a murky light brown, with a persistent light tan head. Aroma is spicy and tangy, like slightly sour milk. Taste is burnt caramel with a big hit of malty sweetness, toast and nuts. Nice carbonation, medium bodied and nice drinking.

6361,"Pours a nice red body, coming up to a thick head. Aromas are yeasty and spicy, light overall however. Flavors of dried citrus and dark fruits coat the taste buds in a mellow smooth taste. Undertones of light hops and brown sugar offer a nice twist of tastings. Drinkable stuff here.

6365,"Bottle:	Another one of the Chimay Cultus I have had many times in the past.	Recently re-drunk this one and after having some of the finest beers in the world, this one still taste damn good.	A nice ruby warm beer, which is maybe even better than all those so called herfst bock beers, yes, definitely better.	A glass of this beer with a good autumn/winter meal makes you enjoy life even more.	This brew still kicks ass!

6366,"Smaller bottle, poured into Chimay goblet. Pours mostly clear reddish-brown. The head fizzes away fairly quickly, leaving a bald spot of foam. Yeasty aroma. Somewhat light-bodied with prickly fizz, the flavor is yeasty, slightly spicy, and fruity...more berries than darker fruits. Plays out as the most summer-y of the Chimays, but that doesnt mean it lacks depth.

6367,"Dark brown to reddish color with longlasting, medium-sized head; aroma of sweet malt: caramel and brown sugar with red berries, red fruits and yeast; mouthfeel is very smooth with pleasant, smooth carbonation, medium bodied; flavor of sweet caramel and strawberry-like fruitness and yeast, and it is at the same time refreshing and warming, maybe a bit of like ""berryjuice"", but not in the bad sense. One could call this an ""easy"" trappist, which is pretty much is, but excellent whatsover.

6368,"""Nice aroma of spicy red fruits, mild clove, yeast and cedar. Amber brown body with a lasting 1/2"" foamy head and solid lacing. Lots of tight, high energy carbonation.

Solid Belgian Ale, somewhat tame all around although its well put together.""

6369,"Appearance: Pours dark copper color with frothy, ariy, bubbleish, beige head, what is fading into a small ring.	Aroma: Moderate yeasty, spicy, phenolic dominance with dried figs, banana, molded cheese and some herbal hops.	Flavor: Moderate, yeasty-based, dried fruity esters, hints of banana and distinct molded cheesy notes. Some herbal hoppy presence at the medium and at the end. The malt profile is a weak point of the flavor. Its way too moderate and subtle, not as rich as you would expect.	Palate: Medium body with light to medium yeast thickness. OK-carbonation.	Overall impression: A bit different kind of Abbey-brown ale what i prefer. Lacks of rich, darker-toasted malty components, but it least has some very unique yeasty and herbal profile.
",5
6370,"Great Belgian beer. I like the flavour of malt and hops in this, which sometimes goes missing in Belgian beers to sugars and spices. Nicely done.
",5
6371,"Chimay Rouge is a very nice Belgian.  I not experienced enough in Belgians to detect major differences between this and the other ""colors"" of Chimay, however it is a nice beer with the same fresh yeasty and fruity aroma I have come to love in Chimay beers.
",5
6372,"330 mL Bottle with a ""serve before end of 2013"" date. Of all the beers I get to sample and report at RB, it is the unpasteurized ""Bire Sur Lie"" or Beer on Lees that fly high and get Brownie points in the Overall section. Here we just have another example. Murky copper body with a pale beige foamy head that settles to a clingy ring. Rich sweet aroma of malts, yeast, apricot, banana, there is something else there too: bubblegum and cherry candy. Wow! This beer is sweet in a way that it doesnt assault the taste buds. Its a mild fruity-sweet and not a harsh / sharp sugar-sweet. The taste is a complex combination of malts and fruits although I can make out bubblegum and Maraschino cherry in the aftertaste. Astringent but velvety fruity finish with a nice clean ending. Belgium, this has got to be one of your aces. Hey Bartender (brandishing my empty glass).

6373,"31-DEC-2009, bottle.	I quite like the blue, so what can the red do?	Brown, off-white head.	Definately belgian. Brown sugar and sweet, very sweet, actually too sweet.	 This is dissapointing. I was expecting much more from this. No rebuy.

",5
6376,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2011 Bottle. The pour was a medium copper in color with an average sized off white foamy head that was mostly lasting and had some what fair lacing. 		The aroma was of a toasted caramel malt, a light resin hop and a sweet yeast with a hint of apricot, banana, dried fruit and some spice (cinnamon and maybe a little nutmeg). 		It tasted very light, sweet and malty with notes of sweet dried fruit and banana in the beginning and finished moderately sweet with a tinge of bitterness that had a nice malty feel to it with notes of caramel and spices at the end. Although I would have liked the flavor to last a nice long while, it only lasted a short time. 		Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied and watery yet somewhat creamy in texture with a flat carbonation. 		Overall a very enticing brew, but anything from this brewer seems to taste well.

6377,"11.2 oz. bottle courtesy of agl108.  Pours a murky amber color with a thick tan head and plenty of floaties.  A subtle aroma of candied sugar, burnt toffee, and dark fruits.  Goes down medium-bodied, fairly bubbly, and definitely on the sticky side.  Taste-wise there is some candied sugar and a plummy flavor upfront.  Burnt toffee flavors follow.  Finishes with a yeasty bite.  Spiciness is evident throughout.  Ok, but I dont really see what all the fuss is about.

6378,"Pours murky reddish with white head.  Aroma of yeast and apple.  Also a metallic hint.  Tastes like yeast with fruit and malt. Finishes bitterish.

6380,"330mL Bottle. Rated blind. Fourth out of a set of 12 Abbey Dubbels. Fresh bread, young yeast, 		and simmered apple aroma. Spring-like and of budding plants. Pours a 		slightly cloudy amber-red, with a reliable finger of rocky off-white 		head. Flavor is quick, peppercorn laiden, and snappy. Good, fresh pils 		malt plays off a vibrant yeast character. Carbonation levels seem to be 		above average. Then a good juicy punch of hops. The flavors are, 		unfortunately, not particularly expressive or deep. This seems pale, 		light, overly yeast forward and lacking in malt breadth. Otherwise, 		solid brewing.	GUESS: Westmalle or St. Bernardus 6
",5
6381,"11.2oz bottle poured into Chimay trappist glass. Pours a nice brown color with a medium-thick, lingering head. Barely any lacing for a beer this thick. Very malty taste and aroma with the yeast clearly detectable. Creamy mouth feel that mirrors the look of the head. A truly delightful brew
",5
6382,"Bottle. Sour/apricot aroma.  Hazy amber/brown body with Tall fluffy head.  Sweet flavor with hints of bitterness. Taste of citrus and malts, very creamy.
",5
6383,"Pours a nice looking mirky brown colour with a foamy white head. The aroma is of malt, herbs and various fruits. The taste is also quite malty and a little bitter with a slight fruity sweetness. Nice finish and overall a good and complex beer.
",5
6384,"Again, had this umpteen times but never rated it. Small bottle. Pours a murky copper with thick head that dissipates slowly. Aroma is musty, slightly vegetal. Mouthfeel is instantly thick and chewy. Taste is hard to describe...malty to be sure with notes of leather and licorice (hint) with a very subdued hop note that I cant adequately describe. Tasty no doubt but, again, young and lacking complexity that Ive experienced from cellared bottles of this beer. Lovely, just not rocking my world tonight.
",5
6385,"UPDATED: APR 10, 2010 Complex noseful of floral hops, yeast, iron, and pollen.  Cloudy brown pour with an odd olive tinge.  It tastes pretty dry, hoppy, and crisp, but with solid malt and light esters in the background.  Dave says this is neither a sipping beer or a gulping beer, but a slurping beer.  Chimay Rouge is not very spicy or sweet for the style.  It is almost like an American version of an abbey ale,  Very enjoyable, but downgraded a bit in 2010, because it seems a little thinner than previously.
",5
6386,"Pours a nice hazy reddish almost copper color with a big tan head that leaves plenty of lace. 	The aroma is lightly nutty and floral with plenty of apple, caramel, and dark fruit (raisin/plum/fig). The beer seemed a bit boring smelling at first whiff but I am loving this more and more each time I raise the glass to my nose. 	The flavor is at first almost like a candied sweetness, but this is fleeting and the beer presents its self with a much drier spicier flavor. This beer has the fruitiness the caramel and the nuttiness that you would come to expect from a good dubbel. However it possesses a quality that continuously mystifies me, there is a defined mineral character to this beer. The earthy Mineral like character was one of the first real flavors that I identified in a beer years ago and its been a real love hate thing ever since, but the mineral qualities in this beer only add to the depth and complexity of this ale and I dare say this for me sets this beer apart from many in its style. There are also those plum raisin and fig characteristics in the flavor that showed up in the aroma. This is a very silky well rounded and perfectly balanced beer, not one bit of the alcohol is really noticeable here. This beer is better than I remember it being.
",5
6387,"Bottle into trappist glass. Pours a rich amber color with a creamy tan head. The taste is of bread, ripe fruit, and a distinct spiciness from the yeast that sticks to the palate. Its a fairly pleasant beer to drink, but I wish the flavors were a little stronger.  Complex but understated.
",5
6388,"Sweet and floral aroma.  Hazy brown with a pillowy white head.  Moderately sweet and a bit dry; hints at fruit (mellon?) and spice.  Overall very subtle but eloquent.
",5
6389,"Pours a dark murky amber color with a creamy off-white head.  Aromas of subdued fruits like raisins and dates, a touch of spice, and maybe a bit belgian yeast coming through.  Initial sweetness is good followed by the spices from the belgian yeast strain.  Some rich dark fruits really come through in the finish.
",5
6390,"750 ml. bottle.  Pours a mud brown with off white head.  Aroma of clove, yeast, fruit, banana.  Taste reveals banana bread, spices.  Lower on carbonation than I expected, and other fruits on aftertaste.  Definitely nice, but a slightly overrated dubbel.

6391,"Bottled. Pours murky brown/gold. It smells of citrus as well as yeast. Palate reveals citrus and grapes slightly sour and bitter, but pleasing overall. Finishes with a nice refreshing tinge of citrus. Good beer.

6393,"UPDATED: APR 14, 2011 Vibrant copper, thick creamy head that fades to just a coating. Nose has stewed berries, earth, citrus, cloves, ginger. Taste is delicate and fruity. Carbonation is there but very restrained, interacts with subtle bitterness to produce a dry finish. [3.8]Big bottle, 11C. Copper with a beige head that fades to a good coat and sticks around. As above, mostly - fruit and spices, dark sugars. Carbonation and some spicy bitterness at the mildly astringent end. Lacks a little depth compared to the other Chimay brews Ive tried,  but its good.

6394,"Cloudy reddish amber body with some light bubbles and an off-white frothy head. Head retention is decent at most.	Quite a complex fruity yeastiness in the nose, with a nice amount of caramel and brown sugar maltiness. Notes of cherry and plum.		The taste starts out with some moderate sweetness, followed by some bitterness and spices (cinnamon, clove). Notes of brown sugar, cherry and apple are quite apparent. The finish is just a bit bitter and bready with some lingering caramel notes.		The beer is medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and some slight pepper-like burning sensation. Quite smooth too.		Pretty good drinkability for a Belgian dubbel. Chimay beers are great all in all, thats exactly why they are so popular amongst beer lovers and connoisseurs.

6395,"Pours a dark brownish amber color with a creamy tan head. Aroma of raisins, plums and caramel. Flavor is mildly sweet and mildly bitter, very well balanced. Creamy texture, lively carbonation. Good beer.

6396,"330mL bottle, pours a cloudy dark reddish brown with a huge beige head into a tulip. Light aroma of apricot, yeast and caramel. Flavour is dominantly malt and yeast, with a dry mouthful and high carbonation. Like the Bleue, this is overrated.

6397,"UPDATED: DEC 24, 2009 Cork has 01/09 printed on it. Im guessing thats the bottling date. 		Beautiful transparent rosewood color. Classic Belgian nose with an understated bouquet of fruit and maltiness. The palate is suave and sophisticated. Perfect sensation, great flavor and a gentle finish. 		Enjoyable, but lacking in aroma and flavor right now. Better with age, I am guessing.

6398,"Pretty old 11.2oz bottle. To the best of my knowledge, this is from about 2001 or 2002. Wasnt sure what to expect from this, seeing as its the smallest of the Chimay beers. Pours pretty dark red and hazy with a foamy head that fades to a nice ring around the glass edge. Nose is fruity and floral, with a little bit of a bubblegum-like note. Flavor has a lot of medium-dark malt, semi-sweet, and theres some yeast presence as well.  A fairly sharp carbonation, which surprised me for a beer thats this old. No evidence of oxidation, as far as I can tell. All in all, I was expecting this to be past its prime, but it seems to have held up nicely.

6401,"Pours amber with thin white head that goes away quickly. Notes of raisin and plum in this, but very light on those. Hits the palate with a pretty strong dry flavor, that finishes clean.
",5
6402,"Dark brown with a dense beige head. Aroma is malty with candy like esters. Flavour is also malty, very round and fruity but with less yeasty flavours than the nose delivers. Body drags this one down for me, too fizzy with sharp carbonation, needs a long time to settle in the glass.

6403,"Vintage 2008. Serving date: 2009-01-21. Served in snifter.		330 ml bottle with freshness date (Best before end of 2012) and recommended serving temperature, glassware and cellaring procedure on the label.		Dark copper color with a 2,5 cm brown-shaded and sparkling head that dissipates rather fast and leaves some small lacings.		A general sweet and fruity smell (kind of like ripe apricots), soft chocolate nougat and notes or grass sits firmly on a backbone of yeast and spices.		At first, sweet malts, fruits and bread hits the taste buds. Then, a mild yeast note and a distinct spicy flavor - primarily cloves - takes over for a while before the finish. Its just slightly vinous. The finish is characterized by a gentle bitterness, even more gentle tartness and spices. Towards the end, it develops a nice caramel flavor.		Medium body, nice and lively carbonation. Very nice mouthfeel.		A very well-composed beer with interesting, pleasant and sometimes subtle notes to be discovered.

6404,"750 mL bottle from my local Farm Fresh, purchased 1 year ago.  Reddish-brown pour with a huge, foamy off-white head.  Aroma of pear, apple, grape, brown sugar and Belgian yeast.

6405,"330mL bottle poured into a Chimay goblet. Cloudy copper color with not much head. There is a nice sweet smell of raisins, molasses, and yeast. Medium mouthfeel and flavor is of fruits, malt, and yeast. There is a bit of bitterness to balance it out. This is quite drinkable at 7% abv. Overall a great dubbel.

6406,"Everyone has heard of Chimay and for good reason, it is a great beer.  Nice interplay between different elements while staying balanced.  Great flavors.

6407,"Very deep, rich, dark amber color. Smallish creamy white foamy head. Decent, but minimal, retention. Almost no lacing.		Big caramel notes on the forefront. Deep, dark fruits that are just a day away from being overripe. Nice, rich malt profile. Nice yeasty quality.		Taste is pretty light, compared to the nose. Nice malty presence, though really not very sweet. Quite earthy and yeasty, actually. Possibly over-carbonated, IMO.		Mouthfeel is creamy enough, but nothing to right home about. The overdone carbonation really hurts it, I think.		I would think of this as a good starter dubbel. 	My least fave from Chimay.

The beer itself is pretty opaque and formed a pretty minimal head in my glass. This beer had a very large bouquet of fruit in the smell. It was overall pretty citrus-y with a mix of orange and lemon smells in it as well as a small hint of the hops in the beer. Once I tasted it, the smell of the fruit obviously right. It produced a slightly woodsy taste to it (almost reminiscent of cedar). It also had an aftertaste of the hops and barley. The beer was also extremely carbonated. Also, of note, the combination of the carbonation, fruits and the sweet flavors almost made this beer seem like a wine. The progression of flavors and textures in the beer made this probably one of the smoothest beers Ive ever had.
",5
6417,"Bottle. Pour is a very murky light brown. Despite best efforts there is heaps of floating sediment. Resonable slightly off white head that disappears pretty quickly. Aroma is quite sweet with plenty of malt and toffee aromas. Also some alcohol and spiceness and perhaps a little dired fruti. Flavours once again shows heaps of malt sweetness, especially up front, toffee, caramale and spicness. A little thin on the finish with some alcohol coming through. A good beer but probably not as great as I remember it from a couple of years ago.
",5
6418,"Bottle. Pours a aubrn color with a small off white head. Head recedes to a small film. Nose is light sugar and toasty sweet malt with a light peppery note even. Palate is full, fluffy with a light peppery finish. Flavors of	light yeast with a toasty malt note and some sugars

6419,"Bottle at virgils in NYC.  Large clove, yeast, and Belgian spice.  Sweet malts and dry candied plums.
",5
6420,"11.2 oz bottle.  Not much aroma here.  The little bit I do smell is of grains; slightly sour.  Pours muddy brown with little head.  Thin island of foam on top.  Excellent taste--maybe its a little old, though.  Not as good as the blue label, but still very good.
",5
6421,"Bottle, 33 cl., tasted blind. A red beer with a medium unstable dirty white head. It smells like some dried fruits, some caramel notes also, light malts noticeable, also light sweet. The taste goes similar to the La Trappe Quadruppel, with the difference you taste this is a beer with a lower alcohol percentage. But anyway: a nice  (dark) fruity taste, some caramel notes, light sweet, some spices included. Not really an aftertaste, but for this beer it doenst matter, as it is a good beer anyway.
",5
6422,"When it comes to Begium Ales, I am a Strong Ale fan.  This beer has a great copper color, nice head, and a better aroma than flavor.  The aroma is sweet and the ligher malt/spiced flavor is not as complex or full as Reds bigger brother Blue.

6423,"An unexpected surprise at The Wyndhams wine and cheese party. Pours mahogany with a thick beige head.  Aromas of brown sugar, citrus, caramel, and some red fruits.  Tastes a bit yeasty, peppery, lots of red fruits.  A perfect balance.

6424,"Poured from a bottle conditioned since 2004.  Pours a dark, cloudy, opaque copper with a soapy off-white head.  Not much on the nose.  I was expecting a lot more.  Some fruityness and hints of raisin.  The taste is very balanced and very drinkable.  Hint of blueberry? and banana, some malt and yeast.  The alcohol is masked beautifully.  Mouth feel is very carbonated and light.  Perhaps it was the conditioning, but this is not the Chimay Red I remember.  That is not a negative comment.  Its just different than the other Chimay Reds ive drank.    If I didnt know it was 7%, i could easily mistake this for a great tasting session beer.

6425,"starter kit for chimay, great belgian dubbel. smells of dried fruits, brown sugar and malts. sweet and malty with hints of dry fruit (raisins and prunes) also some caramel, kinda yeasty too. good stuff, but as most know and agree... the blue and white are better.

6426,"In its glass, while dining out. Dark ruby beer with a finger width off-white head. Sweet malty, caramel apple aroma. Sweet taste of tropical fruit (pears and figs), and just enough bitterness to balance it. Very nice.
",5
6427,"UPDATED: OCT 11, 2009 Taster at Great Lost Bear - Poured a nice coppery dark amber in color with a small off-white head.  Aroma was strong of bready Belgian yeast, fruity esters (dark fruits) and slightly sweet malts.  Flavor followed pretty closely, with some slight hop bitterness to balance things out.  Good...

6431,"Pours deep chestnut brown, Hazy with a tall beage head. Aroma is very bready and yeasty with notes of Dark fruits. Flavour is very malty, mild notes of fruit and bread. Very nice hoppy finish, and not overly complex, but a real treat to drink. And at 7% I could drink this everyday!

6432,"Bottle. Cloudy brown colour. Phenols, medicin, metal, light fruitiness, herbs, some spices, a bit watery. Not a big fan of this one.
",1
6433,"330 ml. bottle. Cloudy brown colour, with a head that dissipates too quickly and leaves almost no lace. Smells of dark fruits, caramel, spices. Body is a bit watery, and mouth has again cark fruits, plums, caramel and some spices. Its a bit of a deception to me when compared to Chimay Blue or White, everything is too soft. I may have to review again when I have another bottle, better the big one.
",5
6434,"75cl corked bottle, as shown. Dark, hazy copper colour, very big, soapy off-white head that collapses rather quickly. Bottle-conditioned double. Complex aroma of fruit, aniseed and candy, not unlike a fruity Bavarian Hefeweizen. The complexity is maintained in the taste: very sweet and fruity at first, then sour and spicy, with a strong and lingering candy-like finish. Aftertaste somewhat bitter. The 7 % abv will weigh you down easily, but theyre well integrated into the taste fabric. However, this is a very sweet-ish Belgian double, and if you dont like that kind of taste, steer clear of Chimay (also of the ""Bleue"" variety). You should drink this cool IMHO, otherwise the sweetness may become too penetrating. While this is clearly a well-crafted brew, I still favour the more bitterish English ESB equivalent. Still, good beer!
",5
6435,"Poured from a 750ml bottle.  Deep amber somewhat hazy from the bottle conditioning.  Off white head that discipates somewhat quickly.  Signature belgian yeast aromas mixed with dark fruits, raisins, plumbs, currants.  Very complex and rich taste, maybe a little oxidation.  Residual sweetness and alcohol warmth lingers.  Body is medium full to full.  A very enjoyable drinking experience. The beer is much better when it warms and the flavors really open up.  This is truely and exceptional beer.
",5
6436,"A little less than the blue for me. Deep copper color, sweet, nice malt flavor.
",5
6437,"Reddish brown color. The complex aroma is in some ways similar to a hefeweizen with the addition of the dried fruit  and spicy flavor.  On the carbonated side, but it helps balance the sweetness.  Fantastic beer.
",5
6438,"Opaque amber color with a plentiful creamy head that maintains itself very well. It has a pleasant candy aroma with caramel and fruit notes.  The flavor has the same sweet and fruity complexity of the aroma with a bitter note. It has a full body but remains very smooth and drinkable.
",5
6439,"Bottle, pours a reddish chestnut with a wispy head.  Nose is belgian yeast, light figs, some chestnuts.  Kind of underwhelming.  Flavor is at first too bitter with a long, bitter finish, faintly cola-like.  As it warms some nice creaminess comes through, with some raisins and figs.  Decent, but too watery.  Heavily carbonated.  Some of the fine nuances are there, but this is just a large step down from the Grand Reserve, and is watery compared to some of the better dubbels out there.
",1
6440,"Pours a copper cloudy copper with a fine off-white head. The aroma is yeasty, with dark fruit, clove, banana, and a hint of caramel. Flavor is similar, with a soft sweetness and a lightly bitter finish. This is frothy and creamy on the palate, with fuzzy carbonation. Nice crisp finish.
",5
6441,"Bottle. Pours deep amber with a foamy, aromatic head. Strong fruit tastes and crisp carbonation. Body is firm and the finish is light, yet satisfying. You can never go wrong with a Chimay, although I still prefer Blue Label.

6442,"33cl bottle.  Red colour like the label.  I prefer the Chimay Blue.  Still a nice beer though
",5
6443,"UPDATED: JAN 31, 2010 Wonderful thick red colour with decent head. Very fruity in both smell and taste and you wouldnt notice its strenght. Also a bit sweet (but not too sweet). A strong beer that you can have a few of.
",5
6444,"short bottle: snifter: crushes my glass with a violent scene of blood flow, some brownish thin head as well.  The nose has lots of roasted and fired qualities, mixed with dark fruits, maybe plums.  The first sip was a killer (which may explain the blood) lots of strong flavors.  Theres complexity in the dark fruits, heavy sugars, cloves and spice, mild metallics, bu tnot sure if I would say balanced.  Let it sit after the first few sips, and noticed some more citrus but alsso more alcohol.  At the end this was tasting great, I was feeling great.  If enjoyed slowly this can take on a nice journey.
",5
6445,"Red-brown with a funky smell and a nice candy, fruit flavor. Very easy to drink, God bless these monks. This is a perfect trappist abbey ale and I wished I had bought a 750ml bottle instead of a 330ml. I need to drink the white and the blue very soon.

6446,"Purchased at West Lakeview Liquors in Chicago, IL as part of a Chimay package w/ a glass, enjoyed while watching week 10 NFL football.  Appearance a very cloudy, murky brown/red with a rich off white head.  Aroma very nice, fruity, very slightly sweet, not really too much of an aroma.  Taste is pretty good, smooth, Belgian yeast presence, fruity (apricot), Ive had the white and I really enjoy it, but with this red Im not as impressed.  Its good, but not great.
",5
6447,"33cl bottle. Dark reddish or dark amber with a good head also a bit red. Nose : Fruity ; mostly cherry. Delicate bread malts. Sip : the beer still foams in the throat. Smooth. Caramel malty. Delicate fruit notes are marked by sour yeast that this beer develops after couple of sips. Good that the sourness isnt like in the cider. The aromatic hops are easily selected in mouth which makes it refreshing. Rare for a dark beer.  Normally I always avoid the red Chimay to jump into blue or golden but I must say that I will have some dilemmas now while choosing between golden and red.

6451,"PSSSSSSSH! Wow, a bit too carbonated, this one! A gusher, and I have to clean my living room table before continuing the rating. The gushing caused the dark amber brownish body to end up very hazy, almost cloudy. The medium-sized off-white head is quite long-lived, and laces the glass very well. A bit faint, moderate sweet malty aroma with noticeable hoppy and yeasty notes. I get caramel, yeast, fruit, honey and spices. Medium sweet and light to medium bitter taste with a long-lasting yeasty dry finish. Flavours are yeast, fruits, honey, spices, caramel and alcohol. Good mouthfeel, but it actually feels a bit thinner that Id expected from an abbey dubbel. Still a very nice beer, may I have another, please? 	[33 cl bottle, from Vinmonopolet Storo, Oslo]

Spicy yeasts are glittery in the nose. Some orange peel, some bar soap. As it warms, it becomes more flowery.		The taste is spicy with a pretty bready base. Belgian yeast with a flowery hop. A spicy, spiky initial flavor, but a sweet citrus/fruity finish, which follows into the aftertaste.		The feel is fizzy and chewy. A big thick consistency, leaving a nice aftertaste.

Flavor is of fermented grains and fruit, unique yeast flavor is present. A little more carbonated than I would have liked, but I like the strong initial flavor of the fruits and grains.

6464,"he last Chimay for me to try is also my favorite of the three styles ..yes yes I know a Quad is technically a bigger Dubbel, bear with me.		Pour is a very murky brown with some floaties and a nice eggshell white head that gets pretty big bud also disappointingly dies down rather quickly.		Smell is great, bread and some light spice and malty goodness, no sign of hops.		Taste is surprisngly bold, mimicking the characteristics of nose with a bit more prominent spice. This is going to rank in front of the White but behind the Blue as far as my taste is concerned.		As with most Belgians, the mouth is refined to a point where you almost take it for granted. Relatively thin and bubbly, where it needs to be.		A fairly easy drinker for a relatively big beer, and definitely a good and slightly cheaper alternative to its bigger brother, but for me anyway it doesnt hang with some of the better dubbels around such as St. Bernarduss 8 and of course the King, Westy 8.

6465,"Excellent!  Many brew dubbels, but this one might be the benchmark.  Plenty of malt brilliance and a perfect mouthfeel.  I will look for another dubbel to top this balanced beauty.

6473,"Has a appearance of a mix of a dark cider and caramel.  The head dies quickly to about 2-3 mm and then lingers on to the end.  Smells like a mix of spices and apples.  The taste pretty much resembles the smell; a sense of spice mixed with a fruity and slightly sweet flavor.  The flavors stand out more after sitting, so dont drink this right out of the fridge.  It has just the right thickness and carbonation, not feeling too thin, and the bubbles tingle when you first drink it.  No lingering bitterness to it either.  Overall, one of my favorites.

6492,"Originally reviewed 5/16/2009...		Let this one (750) warm while trying something else. Corked & caged with a fairly hefty pop of the cork. Into an Ommegang chalice it goes.		Pours what can be described as a murky bourbon color. With a little less red it would resemble a dunkel. Almost a full-finger of bleached ginger-colored head, but it goes quickly, leaving slight yeasty wisps in its wake. Sparse, moderate-speed carbonation.		A slight Belgian sourness is in the forefront at first, but peelin the onion back, but theres plenty of dried and ripe dark fruits backing this deal up. The usual suspects...dates, plums...even a few prunes in there. A little cinnamon and clove with even a touch of praline sweetness behind it all and some dark muscat notes. This is what a Dubbel should be. Still, light-bodied enough not to scare anyone away.		Grain profile is rather hearty, but the taste and body are a little lean...at first. Sure, everythings in there from the nose but its more aromatic and may not deliver the impact as it rolls down the gullet. Grains and light stewy roast (is there Special B in here? New to the whole brewing deal but it seems like thats the ticket) are full-bodied as mentioned but overall weight class may be a bit lean. Good, but lean. The carbonation drives the spice home nicely with only a slight saltiness. Mental note: Let this one warm quite a bit. Would like just a little more sweetness - it actually seems a bit peppery...but its still quite good. Yeast electricity still shines.		This one plays lighter than expected - we have the carbonation to thank for that. Deep dark stewiness is countered by spritely carbonation and pepperiness and other spice along with yeast electricity to dance on the palate and enjoy the ride down. Finish is clean for a normally hefty style.		I have been meaning to review this for a few days but have had to go back to get more at the store. Yknow why? Cause I enjoy drinking it immensely and writing about it gets in the way of its enjoyment. Whaddya think about that? Its damn good.

Banana, and sweet malts comprise most of the flavor, there seems to be a slight smoky aspect to it as well, the flavor is very good but seems slightly watered down. Its strange this isnt getting the lowest marks of all the Chimmays I have drank but its my least favorite, it is the most mild tasting but still dam good.""
",5
6511,"t pours nicely and visually resembles iced tea. It has a larger head than the other two Chimays, but fades faster into a nice off-white ring of foam. The aroma from this beer is one of barley and fruit. It has a fascinating, smooth, dry taste. As it hits the mouth it starts off being very carbonated, but quickly fades into a dry, fruity, caramel-ish taste. The aftertaste is amazing and leaves the hit of barley and apricot behind.
",5
6512,"Bottle  Pours a hazy reddish brown with a good off white head.  Nice stuff floating around.  Has a good aroma of floral, bread, and sweet malts.  Has a good carbonation.  The flavor is well blended.  Not real deep but very refreshing.  Has a medium body.  Good finish and a nice aftertaste.  Not as dry a texture as some of their beers but still a touch dry.  Very drinkable but not my first choice from Chimay.
",5
6513,"Floral aroma, very light and nothing out of place. Its dark and cloudy and reddish brown, with brewed in the bottle particulates. The flavour is smooth and easy with the end flavour being the most prevalant in the aftertaste. The first part of my red, white and blue day of chimay.
",5
6514,"Hazy reddish dark brown colour with lots of particles floating in the bottle. Thick creamy off-white head. Strong - not pungent - sourly, vinous aroma with a whiff of roasted caramel. I could taste notes of berries, almonds and the yeast, accompanied by a great creamy mouthfeel. That sourness didnt contribute distinctly to the flavour, but is clearly adding its complexity in the aroma. Late, pleasant alcohol warmth. I think I might have enjoyed the Dubbel by Westmalle a tiiiny bit more, though, this is a bit too much on the yeasty side...
",5
6515,"A nose of bread, yeast and hops. Taste is a bit sharp - yeast, minerals and a distinct malty flavour that I recognize from the blue counterpart. A good dubbel, but nothing special. It could use some aging.
",1
6516,"Young bottle.  Sweetly malty nose with a little roast, light mineral water and candi sugar yeasty notes.  Dark ruby-mahogany pour does not let light through.  Sudsy off-white head.  Taste is sugary, yeasty, and richly malty, though a little one-dimensional; ends up drying off quite a bit, faint light fruit and air.  Medium body, lightly bitter.  For its relative blandness, this is still very balanced and composed, and the flavors have had some time to mature and mesh together.
",1
6517,"I HAD MERCY !	Looks rich and complex, but actually an easy to drink popular dark supermarket beer but is eminently pleasant. The sort of beer you can drink and hardly notice which isnt everything I want, although it looks the part with its chestnut hues. Certainly not Chimays finest
",1
6518,"This is the first Trappist and the first Belgium beer Ive ever had.  Pour was nice, tons of head.  I had to wait 3-4 minutes before I could complete the pour, and drink.  Color is dark copper, and I picked up wood and cherry hints.  There was so much hype on this beer, on the first 2 to 3 drinks I liked it, but I was not overly impressed.  By the time I was half way done, this had become one of my favorite beers of all time.  This is the absolute smoothest beer I have ever had.  I enjoy hops, I enjoy the sharpess, the bite, the citrus, everything about a good hoppy brew.  But this... This is is just so smooth.  There is no bite, an extremely drinkable beer.  I had someone who cant stand beer try it, and they liked it.  This beer appeals to the masses, I look forward to trying more Trappists beers.
",5
6519,"I really was expecting more from this, especially after how good the White was. It wasnt bad, but it lacked a little bit in the flavor and aroma department.
",5
6520,"Bottle from Papago.  Pours with dissipating ring.  Nose introduces a strange Quebecois yeast quality.  Flavor is dark fruit, brown sugar, tannin, and more of the yeastiness.  Even finish - trails off in the effervescent Trappist way.

6521,"ambrata buona schiuma persistente note leggeremnte tostate un po di malto leggero spezie luppoli in bocca ritornano le note leggeremnte tostate un po di lieviti un tocco di tostato medio amaro
",5
6522,"From the bottle it pours with  huge frothy off white white that quickly diminishes to just a sparse lacing on the surface of the beer. Orange-red colour with some suspended yeast haze. A toasted bread-toffee aroma with some earthy-sweaty notes. Toffeeish taste with some clovey-dried spicesand an alcoholic warmth and a balanced malt sweetness-hop bitterness in the aftertaste.
",5
6523,"Bottle.  Pours an opaque brownish-tawny color w/ a nice off-white head that sticks around.  Aroma is not overpowering on pour.  Autumn spices and fruitiness hit the back of the tongue causing it to tingle as it goes down.  Medium bodied.  A pretty nice brew.
",5
6524,"330ml bottle into a Chimay Trappist glass. A cloudy amber-tan beer with a medium sized off white head providing good lacing all the way down the glass. Generous aromas of cherries, oranges, caramel  and gentle spicy hops. Quite sharp palate with fruity flavours (again a hint of cherries), brown sugars and alcoholic warmth. Finishes with a pleasant gentle spicy hop bitterness that lingers in the mouth. It is medium bodied with a smooth drinkability. A fine Dubbel that is now widely available Down Under thanks to Dan Murphys and First Choice liquor outlets.
",5
6525,"Pours cloudy rich brown with a medium beige head, good lacing.  Smells of apple, banana, pear, bread and hay.  Medium-thick, velvety body.  Tastes of tart apple, caramel, banana, with some hay aftertaste.  Somewhat sour, but balanced.  Very nice brew.
",5
6526,"I really enjoyed this beer, especially the aroma and color. I enjoyed the initial taste, however the after taste was a bit strong for me.
",5
6527,"i drink this beer on Chimay party we have in Sibenik before few days ... this is strong beer and i drink to many different beer ... this one have a 7% alc so this is smooth beer and it is good for drink ..
",5
6528,"From bottle on 05/11/09		Pours a dark amber with moderate creamy head.  Fruity, spicey aroma.  Wonderful taste and a very smooth beer that is excellent with dinner.  Slight bitter finish and a great beer to enjoy a few of in an evening.  First class in its category in my opinion - Cheers!
",5
6529,"A very smooth beer. A very natural fruity taste to it and a creaminess you usually get from a stout. Top notch beer.
",5
6530,"Dark ruby, hazy but not as murky as i remember, not a big head... aroma of pitted fruits and belgian yeast... flavor has a minimal smokiness baconlike with big notes of belgian yeast candi sugar and more pit fruits... remarkably dry finish...
",5
6531,"Bottle, 33cl. Pours an unclear red/amber colored beer with an offwhite head. The aroma is fruit and yeast. The flavor is fruit and just enough hops to create a balanced beer. The palate is soft and balanced. Overall this beer is easy drinkable.
",5
6532,"Bottle. Pours cloudy brown with a fizzy beige head. Aroma is like peeled apple skin, with hints of caramel and spice. Medium body. Flavor has a general fruit sweetness, as well as a light spicy note. Nice.
",5
6533,"Wow, I never rated this? One of the only decent beers at Pocono Brewing Company on bottle. Enjoyable with an accent on the fruits and yeast versus the typical malty dubbel. Nice mix of hops to add bitterness. The palate isnt as wowing as other dubbels and is a bit dull. But a decent beer nonetheless.
",5
6534,"I kept this magnum bottle at room temperature because I wanted to drink the beer at a slightly higher temperature  expecting a deeper and more complex taste. There is a lot of pressure when I remove the cork, the beer tries to find its way out immediatly.		Colour: Chimay Premire leaves a reddish brown beer in the glass, slightly hazy with not much carbonation. The creamy head is thick and beige. It leaves a nice lacing on the glass when dissapearing very slowly.		Aroma: very sweet smell with a malty undertone and a spicy touch of pepper. A very inviting and intense smell.		Taste: Chimay Premire is a very drinkable beer with an ABV of only 7%. At first, the taste seems relatively simple, dominated by malts and hop bitterness. When taking a few more sips however, the beer becomes complex of taste and very well balanced with a warming alcohol presence. The full body is combined with a fresh crispness. The mouthfeel is a bit like syrup and sticky. The dry finish makes you longing for more instantly.		Try this beer with a beef stew  why not use it IN the beef stew. Chimay Premire will also go well with any grilled meat dish. And why not drink it as dessert ? Beats a cappucino !
",5
6535,"Bottle - Pours reddish brown with a frothy off white head.  Nice mix of spice and fruit in the aroma.  Smooth mouth feel. The alcohol comes through nicely in the taste.
",5
6536,"Its a good beer, but I love the triple (blanche) so much that Ill usually choose it over the chimay red.  Not to say that this isnt a great beer... strong taste of alcohol, light florals.
",5
6537,"UPDATED: DEC 20, 2011 Aroma: Dark malt, Belgian yeast is very pungent.		Appearance: Opaque brown with a pillow style head and carbonation action in the goblet.		Taste: Rich. Light caramel, light bitterness, mostly just a smooth belgian ale with a semi-dry finish.		Palate: Thick but smooth.  The quality is clear from the first sip.		Overall: Incredible beer.  Its nearly impossible to pick a favorite Chimay.  All three are killer.
",5
6538,"Dark brown, light, big bubble head that sticks well. Medium-dark reddish brown. Tons of spice in the aroma, along with a good dose of Trappist funk. Effervescence is high, but doesnt bite too hard--actually quite soft. Good dryness to it. A bit of metal and fruit rind in the flavor.
",5
6539,"Brown with only a little head which only lasted for a short time. Probably the bottle was not chilled enough. intensive smell of banana, citrus and other fruits. tastes quite the same. some spicy flavours in there, too. full body and soft carbonization. long lasting taste of yeast and a little bitterness can be found at the end. very good!
",5
6540,"Tasted from bottle into tulip glass. Poured a beautiful copper color with some yeast haze and frothy, dense, lasting off-white foam, some Belgian lace. Aromas of sweet bread, caramelized brown sugar, rising dough, some plum, raisins and dried cherries, no late hops. Flavors of rich, diverse malts: bread, toast, biscuits, toffee, more dark stone fruits, slight clove balanced by low earthy hops bitterness. Medium body with well-rounded mouthfeel, lasting sweetness and fruitiness in the finish. High carbonation, tiny bubbles from active bottle fermentation. Delicious in every way. An absolute masterpiece.
",5
6541,"Bottle from a sample pack. Sweet and fruity with a light tartness. grows more complex as it warms up. A touch of bitterness at the end.
",5
6542,"Pours a deep amber. Bready malty nose. Smells musty and slightly fruity. Medium to full body.
",5
6543,"11.2 oz. bottle (2008) in my brand new Chimay goblet. Beautiful appearance: pours a copper-amber/ruby w/ a generous rocky, white head that keeps bubbling away angrily. Carbonation from the bottle re-fermentation is evident. Nose is candy sugar and spicy fruits. Bananas, bread, toasted malt and a whole lot of hoppy bitterness in the flavor. Medium-bodied and extremely dry. Not as good as the Bleue, but underrated in my view. Maybe a shade too dry. Caramel and toffee notes as it warms. Finishes figs in alcohol.
",5
6544,"malty but not sweet or dry, lightly smokey roasted  light cherry mild rasin, soft, finishes with fig and dark fruit and well balanced bitterness. Complex and luxurious. Unparalleled craftsmanship, would be the best rated beer on earth if it were harder to get.
",5
6545,"This is the first Chimay I have had, but hopefully not the last. Ive been enjoying abbeys lately, as I had until recently never tried one. Served cold from bottle. Dark red/amber color with a thick off-white head. Yummy flavor with good fruity notes and sweet/bitter interplay. An enjoyable beer.
",5
6546,"A pleasant beer, with caramel flavor, nice color and good maltiness. Too much carbonation, though. I would like the opportunity to try this one on tap some time.
",1
6547,"UPDATED: JUN 10, 2009 My favorite of the Chimays. Not too strong (like the Blue) but still with most of the complex character. Been having one of these every so often for 20+ years. Always a winner.

6548,"Murky amber/red, little beige head. Flavor a bit yeasty, malt and grass. Faint aroma, mightve been served a little too cold. No alcohol in taste or aroma. Lovely soft feel.

Aroma: Strongly yeasty, winy, very well pronounced notes of red, fresh fruits like red currant, wildberry, red grapes, cherry, plum, notes of peanuts and wallnuts, very fresh and juicy, quite strong and essential, slightly woody and some strange notes of spicyness giving mixed reception and varing opinions, dry autumn leaves, dirt, well aged and quite ripe but all in all not that multidimensional as expected, powder sugar, some notes of English and American hops, very Dubbel like.	Flavour: Very strong taste in overall impression, very focused and nice, strong bitterness, very dry, some Crystal and Pilsen malt, leavy hops, great aftertaste, very warming beer with long lingering finish, very mellow, yeasty texture, thick because of yeast, perfectly hidden alcohol but contributing to the fantastic warmth in the aftertaste, notes of red fruits, wallnut skin bitterness, winy, red wine grapes, plum, cherry, Porto wine, very robust, kind of tangy, very spicy, great flavour as compared to its appearance and better but still not that good aroma.

6551,"Bouteille 33cl. La Chimay ""brune"" est en fait ambre et assez classique. Un gout acidul reste en bouche et doit provenir de la levure sachant que cette bire ne contient pas de bl.

6552,"750 mL bottle from Trader Joes (Hillcrest).  Trader Joes seems to have the best local prices on Chimay -- $7.99 for red, $9.99 for blue.  Pours a dark rusty red with a thin layer of off-white head.  Aroma of malt, yeast, and dark fruit.  Sweet taste of malts along with yeast.  A slight fruitiness and some spice in the finish.  There is something distinctly earthy here as well.  Not terribly complex.  Good carbonation.  Probably my least favorite of the three Chimays.
",5
6553,"750mL bottle, gift for 21st birthday. I warmed this one up a bit. Pours deep hazy red/orange, sediment came in the second pour from the bottom. Tan head. A strong caramel malt note in the aroma, bringing with it some raisin. Hops are detectable on the aroma, which I like. Feels spritzy on the tongue, that raisin fruit comes in first, followed by a relaxed hop bitterness which slowly fades to the astringent finish. Quite enjoyable, and not overly complex, i could have two or three of these. Very nice.

6555,"Coppery brown pour into THICK foamy (slightly creamy) head that dissipates into a ring of foam around the rim and a pool of bubbles in the center of the glass. Aroma of fermented fruit and yeasty sweet bread. Initial flavor of toasted caramel malt with a slightly bitter hop finish.

6556,"33cl stubby bottle, at least a year old.  Pours a hazy amber with a large light foam off-white head that settles to a thin covering.  Aroma is candied and ripe dark fruits, yeast, and some light caramel.  Flavor is lighter than expected, with more ripe and candied fruits, yeast and light caramel.  A milder and accessible entry level belgian beer, but nothing too special or complex.
",5
6557,"Dry fruity overrated brew that goes to shit if there is some age on it and tastes like cardboard. The palate is good though and this is still very drinkable if reasonably fresh.
",1
6558,"Bottle, like in the name red colour, small head, mild sweet, yeasty, balanced caramel taste, too strong copper taste - like you smell on a 1 eurocentcoin. The Chimay red is in my opinion the best chimay!

6559,"Bottle, 33 cl. 	Smells a bit like metal...	But taste is very nice, a bit sweet and very sparkling. Colour is wonderful.	Undoubtedly the best of the Chimays existing.

6560,"UPDATED: JUL 24, 2009 The best chimay makes, flavor is better than the blue , in my opinion. Seven percent abv is unnoticeable. This beer goes with any dinner or by itself is a great beer.

6562,"750 pours a cloudy brown with a slight white head, lots of lacing.  Aroma of caramel, sugar, yeast, spice.  Taste is similar with plenty of yeast, malt, and caramel.  Very enjoyable.  Mouth is smooth and nicely carbonated.  Great balance.  Overall, a very enjoyable trappist ale.  Lots of complexity.

6563,"Aroma of sour apples and sugary fruit. Yeasty sediment makes for a translucent pour, head went away quickly. Flavor had some caramel character along with ripe fruit. Palate was mildly lively. Decent, but I expect more from a Trappist beer.

6567,"750ml Bottle. Pour with thick head, a dark red color. Malty yet sweet aroma. Taste fruity with a hint of citrus. Too drunk to give this a proper description.
",5
6568,"From the 750ml bottle. I have had this many times, but when I decided to rate it, it turned out to be amazingly disappointing. Nothing was wrong with the bottle or its age, but this was not an interesting beer. Too young, maybe? Weak, somewhat vegetal aroma. Light body and light flavor, with not near enough malt. Very boring.
",1
6569,"Aroma is very yeasty-bready, almost minty.  Alcohol, candy sugar.  Body is smooth, silky.  Hints of tart fruit, malty just a bit of candy sugar.  Very smooth, carbonated just right.  Its pretty mellow and very balanced and clean.  Nice one.

",5
6572,"Bottle 330ml, 2008. Hazy copper colour, small light brown head. Fruity aroma, citrus and kiwi in it. Pretty light body, taste has fresh fruits, raisin, hint of nuts; yeast in the finnish.

6573,"Pours a hazy amber color, very inviting.  Has a very malty flavor, incredibly smooth, and just enough bite to balance out the sweet flavors.  Has a nice thick feel, and carbonated just right.  An excellent beer!
",5
6574,"A delicious-looking cloudy brown beer with a large tan head that lasts. The aroma is a pleasant sweet fruity malt-based smell with some earthy and yeasty notes. The flavor is a bit weaker, but interesting, with some dark and dried fruit with roasty notes. Mouthfeel is a little thin.

6577,"33cl bottle from Systembolaget.	Grey/brown/plum with a yellowish head. 	Lots of fruit and belgian yeast in the aroma. 	Sweet smooth mouthfeel. I get the impression of a distorted kind of macro brew.

6581,"UPDATED: MAR 17, 2009 33cl bottle (brewed 2007).  Pours a nice copper color with decent head that fades, but leaves nice lacing throughout.  Some floaties were noted. Aroma is of malt, brown sugar, and raisin/prune.  Taste is pretty much the same, dark fruit, nice esters, very smooth, nice prickly co2 on the tongue.  Finish is dry with pretty low hops bitterness.  This is a great one.

6586,"Huge aroma of dark fruity as soon as I pour.  Nice reddish hue with lively white head.  Not long lasting and mo real lacing.  A touch of sour on the nose as I embelish a little more.  Flavor is definitley fruity esters and a cherry finish.  Some note of belgian yeastiness.  Lots of bubbles throughout, I can reinvigorate head with little movement.  Nice easy finish.  Not chewy at all, a little lighter in body than I was anticipating.  But all goes nicely together.

6588,"UPDATED: MAR 28, 2011 Pretty hazy, ruby pour. Had several different sweet notes in the taste, with a hint of bitterness on the finish. Excellent. 4.5	RE-RATE 3/28/11 Bottle from World Market.  This beer pours a lightly cloudy amber red, rich with orange highlights.  There is a nice smooth white head that doesnt disappear.  It gets fairly murky towards the top of the glass.		Man I could smell this beer from way above the glass.  All good things though!  It has a very yeasty smell, even though I saved the yeast dregs at the bottom of the bottle and saved them for my homebrew.  There is a nice dark fruit aroma as well, such as black cherries or tart plum.  Very nice.		The flavor is immediately lightly tart, which reminds me of grape juice.  A nice touch of sweet flavors from the fruitiness also fill in well.  It finishes with a yeasty dryness that doesnt linger longer than need be.  The alcohol begins to be tasted at warmer temperatures, but only in the slightest.		Man this is good beer.  The Belgians know how to do it!  Well I guess technically the monks dont since they took a vow of chas....you know what, never mind.  Enjoy the beer and leave me to enjoy mine.

6589,"bottle, indeed less complex than the chimay blue, also not as long a finish. But a very nice beer nonetheless, and even might be easier to drink than the blue one.

6590,"Great belgian.  I am absolutely in love with Chimay, RED WHITE AND BLUE baby.  Enjoy this one with some sharp chedda.
",1
6591,"From bottle. Brown pout with big white creamy head. Spicey, fruity aroma. Flavor is lightly spicey and sweet, balanced with belgian candi sugars. Lots of belgian yeast and some bread.  The mouthfeel is excellent. When I was just getting into beer, this was one of the best Id ever had. Its still pretty damn good.
",5
6592,"11.20oz bottle. Another excellent Chimay. Though not as complex as the Blue there is still alot going on here. Nice frothy head with lingering fizzy carbonation. It is sweet but not overly.

6593,"From bottle. Fantastic aroma of spice, oak, herb and sweet honey. Deep ruby red with a lively head. Sweet flavour initially. Great flavour of sweet spice and oak, cinnamon. Silky texture, smooth yet tangy with a lively finish. Really enjoyed this beer and hit the spot on the occasion.

6594,"bottle. Deep cooper-brown color, with a big head, a little fizzy, long aftertaste.
",5
6595,"UPDATED: JAN 27, 2011 Enjoyed via 12oz bottle.  Appearance and nose are the prototype for the style, dark, fluffy off-white head, and dark fruits and burnt or candied sugar.  Palate is nicely malty, showing a pleasant dark fruit esters; full without being cloying.  Carbonation is nicely calibrated.  The finish shows lingering notes of continental character malt residual sweetness, along with the aforesaid ester notes.  Overall, a somewhat ubiquitous but inarguable benchmark of the style.  Excellent.
",5
6596,"bottle. Poured cloudy reddish-brown with off-white head. Citrus, yeasty aroma with some pepper. Peppery flavour with high carbonation that bites the tongue. Astringent finish.
",1
6597,"Reddish brown pour with a fine looking light tan head. Very fruity aroma. Apricot, peach,  apple with a mild yogurty sweetness. The flavor is  yeastier. Also more bread and caramel, but still quite fruity. The finish is very clean and dry, almost surprisingly so, and rounds the rich flavor out nicely. Very good, very drinkable beer.
",5
6598,"Overall a very good beer, but not a flavorfull as some other Trappist Ales Ive had before.  There is almost no aftertaste when you drink it.  I had bought this and Fin Du Monde also, and actually enjoyed the Fin Du Monde better.  This is still a very good beer and will probably buy again.
",5
6599,"Pours slightly hazy bright burnt orange with a tall beige head that has great retention (there till the glass was gone), likely due to the high effervesence, leaves some lacing as well. Aroma is grassy, caramel, blossoming fruit trees, fruity yeast, a hint of toast, and apricot preserves. Flavor is grass, apple, toast, caramel, fruity yeast, dark fruits and sweet grain. Finish is slightly acidic fruitiness, burnt sugar and some grassy, spicy notes. Bitterness is present and about average for a dubbel.
",5
6600,"Larger bottle (750?).  Pours a deep amber color with a medium off white head with good lacing.  The aroma is yeast, fruit, vinous, caramel malt.  The flavor has more yeast, vinous, moderately sweet caramel like malt, and other fruits.  Dry, somewhat  fruity finish.  This is decent enough, but probably wont revisit anytime soon.

6602,"Bubblegum licorice malty smell.	Pinkish amber color with an apple juice hue and a minimal frothy off white head. Lots of funnelling carbonation action and some suspended sediment.	Smooth and rich taste of sweet malt with a minor sweet sourness.	Medium bodied, resinous in the direction of syrupy, and the funneling carbonation is soft and fizzy.	A very good Dubbel, whether a session beer or not could be debatable, how its served, and how its prepared to be served.
",5
6603,"Bottle. Dark brown colour with a large off-white head. Spicy aroma with notes of yeast. The flavour is malty and some yeast with hints of fruits and spices. Nice medium-bodied dubbel.

6604,"The first of my Authentic Trappist beers.  Im pretty pumped about this one.		Serving:  11.2 oz bottle poured into my Chimay glass.  08-314 stamped on label.		A:  Pours a dark brown/copper.  Very cloudy and hard to see through.  Fine beige head.  Floaties big and small but not numerous.  Definite lace work. 		S:  Malty sweet aroma.  Reminds me of cheap whiskey aroma.  Toasty.  Complex.  There is a aroma I cant put my nose on.  Slight hops too, but not too noticeable.  Spice, clove.		T:  Fruity and sweet with a touch of hops.  There is that whiskey malt again.  Earth and wood, maybe a tad whiff of smoke too.  A slight alcoholic bite, but not bad at all.  Very flavorful.		M:  The carbonation is nipping at my tongue.  A longish finish makes me want to take another drink right away to replenish what Im tasting.  Just a tad dry and bitter.		D:  Very drinkable for 7% ABV.  Its not overly expensive for being a beer from one of the six Trappist breweries.  		Overall, I am very pleased with my first true Trappist brew.  I have read that Red is not the best from Chimay, but that ok because I bought the gift set with all three plus my awesome goblet.  So, I only have two more to look forward to!

6605,"Bottle. Poured hazy brown with a fizzy tan head that settles quickly. Aromas of prune, a malty background and light spices. The flavor was much the same with some raisin also coming out. Medium body, dry, lively carbonation.
",5
6606,"Looking through my old notes and found this rating and was suprised I had not entered it already.  The smell is fruits, yeast, some spices, candi sugar, and dried fruits.  The look is a muddy reddish color with a good beiged colored foamy head.  The taste is a alcohol, spices, yeast, and fruits.  Very good beer.
",5
6607,"Bottled from the local supermarket. Murky brown color, foamy thick head. sour nose. Aroma is alcoholic with malts. Flavour is dominated by yeast. Very nicely composed. The BEER
",5
6608,"My favorite abbey ale simply because I can find this one when I want it.  The last bottle I purchased was very sweet and had concentrated caramel flavors and some fruitiness.  The amber color was extraordinary and the head was relatively thick.
",5
6609,"Bottle.  Dark amber coloured with nice beige head. Aroma: spicy mostly of corriander. Flavor: caramel, ligth citrus.
",5
6610,"(Bottle from Tescos, Diss) Poured dark with a hint of reddiness, and no head. A big smell with fruit, vanilla, and a bit of tartness. Had a high carbonation, and tasted fruity, with a good malt base and elements of herbs, spices, bread. Generally sweet with a bitterness coming in towards the end. A decent beer I could drink much more of. Complex but not over the top for regular drinking. Very good.
",5
6611,"Dark red brown color true to the style.  The aroma was wheat and other cereal grains, yeast, vague plum fruitiness.  The flavor was wheat, spicy, fruity.  The finish had a mild bitterness.  Relatively thick mouthfeel.  Good beer overall.
",1
6612,"A decent Chimay beer but not as good as the blue. Red in color. Very fruity with a smooth finish.
",5
6613,"Pours a ruddy amber with a finger of cream head, some decent retention. Yeasty nose, some caramel, bready, sweet, plum. Medium sweet, caramel, spicy and bready yeast. Bitterness enough to offset the sweetness. Creamy mouthfeel, medium carb, light body.
",5
6614,"Bottle. Amber color. Decent head. Not as good as the blue. But a decent beer.
",5
6615,"Poured out of a small bottle.  The deep copper color of this beer looks great in the glass (trappist of course), and it has a very pleasing yet subtle fruity aroma.  The balance of this beer is fantastic between the sweet malts, the slightly bitter hops, and the warmingly high (but not overly so) ABV.  There is a little more carbonation than i would prefer from a nice dark beer, but in this case I can definitely make a case for letting that go.  I could definitely drink this every day, its smooth yet full of flavor.  I dont know why I dont drink it more often.
",5
6616,"Dark red-brown with a finger of off white head.  Lightly metallic malty aroma, some pit fruits, cherries.  Taste is light, thin malts, nuttiness, more fruits and a light spiciness.
",5
6617,"Bottle. Hazy brownish colour with a huge off white head. Rich aroma and taste of malts, dark fruits, spice and yeast. Nice mouthfeel.
",5
6618,"Pours a hazy burnt orange with little head. Aromas of soft and dark fruits, spice, and bready yeast. Tastes plums, bananas, bread, and cloves. Great mouth feel with light small bubbles. Really nice dubbel.
",5
6619,"Bottle.  this beer was excellent.  I havent had a Chimay in a while.  complex flavors of fruit with some great spice.  I could drink this every day.
",5
6620,"bottle - hazy brown beer with a beige head. A lot of yeast and fruity flavour. Some banana. Sweet and malty flavour. Traces of bread and yeast. Alcohol is easily detectable.
",5
6621,"750 ml - Dark orange-brown, foamy off white head.  Raisin and fig nose warms to soft hints of sweet iced tea.  Plummy grape flavors ride touches of yeasty sweet spice.  Light to medium bodied, medium carbonation, dark fruity finish.  A classic, but has been passed by many others over the years...
",5
6622,"Beer pours a nice rust brown, has a very creamy light head that smells of fruits and berries. This beer has a nice mouthfeel very smooth and velvety. Slight bitterness, definitely notes of hops, berries, a bread note as well. Nice beer, had this many many times just now rating it. Try this one.
",5
6623,"A white nice head, which didnt last that long. Darkbrown, little redish colour. Some sweetness in the smell and some malt. Little fruit and alcohol in aroma. Soft, round and creamy feeling in the mouth. Little cake or tart in the taste and some bready malt.
",5
6624,"750ml corktop bottle from the LCBO. Pours a beautiful dark brown/red with a thick beige head with a tint of red. Aroma is caramel and malt. Slightly spicy. Taste is somewhat sweet with Belgian yeast, caramel and malt. Some spices. bread like flavour with some toffee. 	Nothing in the flavour stands out as being really bold. This is a solid well rounded and balanced beer.
",5
6625,"Bottle. Dark brown with a minimal head.  Berries and the typical belgian trappist taste. Not Bad.
",5
6626,"Very nice and balanced. Dark amber with a medium, frothy, tan-colored head. The aroma suggests notes of fruit cake, malts, caramel, and a bit of yeasty citrus. The taste is sweet and bitter, but not overdone either way. The mouthfeel is solid and assertive, with vigorous carbonation and a medium body. Very, very nice.
",5
6627,"pours a cloudy brown with thick foamy head.  fruity aroma, dark fruits, like figs.  a bit of brown sugar in the taste.  robust flavor.  excellent
",5
6628,"Dark fruit and a hint of alcohol in the aroma.  The flavor is fruity, possibly raspberry/strawberry and malty.  Not quite at the top but very solid and a good ale either way.
",5
6629,"A: The taste has ripened fruit, fig, yeast and some caramel malts	A:  Pours a murky ruby brown with a thin bubbly tan head.  The carbonation is very lively upon the pour.	T:  The taste is a smooth blend of the same aromas; dark ripe fruit, caramel malt and a little spice.	P:  Decent lively carbonation, but smooth	O:  I have had this offering before, but just now rating.  Very nice and almost at any respectable bottle shop.  Heck I found this down in Australia where the variety is particulary poor in the area I in.  Just an overall good beer.
",5
6630,"Brown in color with ruby highlights. Aroma is of sugar, sweet malts, plums and figs. Taste is of sweet malt, light hops, fruit, and yeast.
",5
6631,"Bottle. I would almost agree with those who would rate Chimay Blue higher. However I found that I needed to look beyond the first impression to find Reds beauty. Its fruity aroma is very subtle and its look in the glass is all class. Red has great color and head to match. It is a bit over carbonated, but I am willing to overlook it because it has  a near perfect balance of malt and hops and alcohol. The bitter aftertaste is just right. This is a very dry and refreshing brew. Not to light and not to heavy. It makes me wish I had some fresh sourdough bread and hard cheese to eat.
",5
6632,"From the bottle, pours a hazy dark reddish with a thick bubbly off-white head. Not much in the nose. Taste is thin, some berries, kinda watery. A bit of yeast, finishes clean. Its ok, but I dont think its as good as its bretheren.
",5
6633,"Pours a hazy rusty reddish brown. A thin white head goes away pretty quickly to form a ring around the glass.		The smell is very sugary and heavy on malt. Dried dark fruits come to mind, prunes, raisins, there is some apple juice and grape juice. Lots of yeast and almost no alcohol smell.		Initially this beer is pretty sugary and sweet with a faint sourness on the sides of the mouth. The hops are spicey and add to the bitterness. The finish is sweet and spicey with a lot of fruityness. 		Medium bodied with a crisp carbonation. Good drinkability.
",5
6634,"While this is an excellent beer, it simply does not match up to Chimay Blue.  In many ways these are similar, however the Red has a more pronounced carbonation, nearly becoming acerbic.  Despite this, the beer is rather sweet and creamy, with a feeling of clarity in the depth of it.
",5
6635,"Cloudy amber with an off-white head.  Belgian yeast, spices, and light fruits create a fairly complex taste. Sweet finish, medium body.  Solid and widely available.
",5
6636,"750ml. bottle from Trinity Liquors in Spring Hill, FL. Aroma of light floral notes, citrus, alcohol...not a very strong aroma. Pours cloudy cream soda color with a thin white head. Flavor is light malt, citrus, flowers, yeast...Nice mouthfeel...Its pretty good...not nearly as good as the Chimay Blue or White.
",5
6637,"Cloudy copper body with an off-white head, a bit fruity on the nose.  Slight bitterness provides the balance to the sweetness and fizz.  A fine dubbel.
",5
6638,"Small Bottle: Pours cloudy amber with a reddish hue. Has a thin to medium tan head with little to no lacing. Smells of caramel and hops. Tastes of bread, caramel and sweet malts. Leaves the palate with an exotic fruit & malt blend.
",5
6639,"Ultimately disappointing.  On the nose some sweet malt but also a nasty whiff of alcohol.  There is some fruit & malt & sweetness on the rounded palate but then the flavours disappear into a chalky dryness leaving you feeling the whole thing is a little thin & unbalanced.  The final flavour is a fairly pleasant spiced fruit but by then its too late.
",1
6640,"Poured reddish coppery color with small head.	Aroma is sweet and alsovery yeasty.	Flavor is malty and sweet. I know this beer is rated high but this really is more like wine. 	Palate - syrupy mouthfeel with below average carbonation. 	Overall - a good beer if this is the beer you prefer.
",5
6641,"12 oz bottle conditioned bottle. Pours a dark amber with a cream/off white head that sticks around. Aroma is a yeasty sweetness, a touch of malt and spice. Flavor is a little bit of spice, with a bit of malt character, then a slight hop finish. An almost vanilla-toffee flavor before a slight alcohol feel as well.
",5
6642,"[50cl bottle.] Cloudy reddish brown with a loose white head; sweet yeasty aroma; rich malty flavour with lots of caramel and hints of vanilla and biscuit; creamy finish. Really good.
",5
6643,"
",1
6644,"Pours dark brown with a cm of creamy off white head.  The aroma is sweet, and I detect notes of Belgian yeast, horse blanket, cheese, clove, dates, and a bit of pepper.  The flavor is moderately sweet, mostly of malt, but has a presence of coriander and and finishes with a lactose like taste.  The mouthfeel is nice and creamy.  This is one of my favorites.
",5
6645,"750ml shared with Pyroziod and French Tickler.  Red brown and hazy with an offwight creamy head.  Aroma: rasberry, banana, cinnamon.  Flavor: alcohol, light taste of pepper, salt raisins grapes and plum.  Palate: medium body, average carbonation.

6646,"Bouteille de 750 ml Dgust avec french tickler et Agaguk. Bire de couleur brune brumeuse avec un moyen collet tres collant. Arome de sucre, tres fruit, bananes et un soupon de vanille. Gout de sucre brun, vanille et bananes qui revient.
",5
6647,"Clovey raisin spice, some fresh dough.  Cloudy deep amber, big head with nice lacing.  Orange peel seared in honey sweetness/bitterness flavor, funky bitterness.  Medium to full body, creamy big carbonation, strong and long finish.  Solid beer, great complexity, just enough alcohol to keep it approachable.
",5
6648,"Some dark foggy yeast and faint raspberry.  The bottle gushed a bit upon opening, though did not have an overactive amount of head in the glass.  The head was weak in body and fell quickly.  The body is a picturesque amber, nicely dense with sedimentary goodness.  soft gentle ripe plum and blackberry notes, rounded out nicely.  Light on the palate.  more dark fruits, i getting the apricot now, finish is pretty abrupt after all that sweetness.  Some leather too.
",5
6649,"Bottle at home. Another fantastic beer. Chimay is really excellent for such a commonly available beer. Foamy head and very nice aroma. Prefer the white, by a hair.
",5
6650,"Bottle. I think I got an old bottle because there were some floaties and sediment that were suspended after the pour. Other than that, this was damn tasty. Nose is malty and gives off some nice light fruity accents. Flavor is very smooth and malty with flavors of some dark fruits, maybe a little molasses flavor, and low bitterness.
",5
6651,"Sweet aroma like maple syrup, strong alcohol. Some yeast and fruits like apple and plum.	Boysenberry in the flavour along with a pepper spice, yeast and alcohol. Very nice.
",5
6652,"(Old notes). A good belgian dubbel. Sweet, fruity, burnt sugar notes. I also found orange  peel too. A good beer from Chimay.

6655,"Bought this as part of a Chimay holiday 3-pack that came with a Chimay glass.  Poured a deep caramel color with a dark, creamy head.  It gave off a nice scent of fruit that was predominantly apricot.  Drinking out of the accompanying glass left ribbons of yeast settling at the bottom, giving the beer a sweet finish.
",5
6656,"UPDATED: SEP 13, 2009 330ml bottle.  Pours a muddy, cloudy brown with a tan head.  Nose is of raisins and some barnyard.  taste is nicer than the smell with raisins and caramel most noticeable.  Mouthfeel is medium-to-thin with tons of carbonation.  Nice brew.
",5
6657,"Bottle, pours a red beer with a huge foamy white head.  aroma is sweet fruit, not rotten fruit though.  Flavor is sweet and carbonated.  Not as yeasty as I was expecting it to be.  The body is very smooth and complex, yet balanced.  I have not completly figured this one out, I will probobly drink this one again.

6658,"UPDATED: JUL 23, 2011 ...re8 330ml  In my Chimay goblet to try and make this a better expereince than previously , call my ass biased , but its cooler for it . nose is rasins, apple , some rich malts and yeasty must .  It looks very good , just like any o Chimay .. Its smooth and silky on opening , then notes of toffee apple , rasins , figs , some bitter  boozy notes in a dry creaminess.   Pretty nice on reflection.

6659,"Pours a burgandy color with a white forming head.  Great aroma of apricot and fruits.  Very pleasing to the mouth upon drink but finishes a little bubbly.  Great dubbel, great brew.  Thank you to the Monks of the Chimay team.
",5
6660,"750 mL bottle.  Pours hazy brown with a light tan head.  Aromas mainly of dark fruits, red grapes and raisin.  Flavors of raisin, cherry, nuts, a bit of yeasty green apple, and a pleasant touch of alcohol.  An excellent dubbel.
",5
6661,"Very very unique. A bit sweet but nice and strong. A great compliment to the other two chimays
",5
6662,"Full malty beer. Fruity: Cherries, apricots, a bit vinous. Rich and complex, very Belgian. A little stable or barnyard. A great beer.
",5
6663,"This pours dark brown with a good rich color.  This is not the best Chimay has to offer but still a top of the line beer as it is well rounded from front to back.  The aroma could be better, but the taste makes up for it.
",5
6664,"very rich flavored and fresh. spicy and delicious. Very highly appreciated. No doubt.
",5
6665,"14 Nov 2008: Brown, somewhat unclear, hazy, large head. Be careful with the yeast in the bottom of the bottle, even though some of it should be included. It actually makes it better, less sweet taste. A bit sweet aroma, smells like Belgian beer. Sweet bitterness. I am generally not a great fan of Belgian beer, but this was actually not bad at all.
",1
6666,"Rust colored pour with a large rocky off-white head.  Soft dark fruit aroma with faint candi sugar, alcohol, pepper, banana, and slight green apple.  Apple cider flavor with notes of plum and spice.  Dry medium body with lots of carbonation.
",5
6667,"Bottle from set available at the wooden keg.  This is probably my favorite of the blue, red and white.  So smooth and buttery.  pours dark brown maybe a hint of red with lots of thin bubbles.  Taste is bitter and overly bubly at start but as the beer warms the palate becomes smooth and the flavor really comes out.
",5
6668,"Bottle. Poured a murky copper with a tan head. Has a hop and fruity aroma. Has a mild roasty taste, with a hop finish.
",5
6669,"Pours a beautiful dark amber red/brown with a thick nicely laced white head. Has a yeasty malty aroma with notes of dark fruits, bread and caramel. Flavour about the same with some spicy hoppy notes. Excellent beer.
",5
6670,"Musty, woody aroma with floral notes.  Flavor of yeast, must, cobwebs.  Not as bad as the description makes it sound, just not nearly as good as Chimay Blue.
",5
6671,"Pours a deep amber with very red hues when held to the light.  Very attractive creamy white head.  Aroma is strongly alcoholic, with some hint of yeast and balanced nicely by some hidden malts.  Alcohol fades on the taste and is replaced mostly with malts.  Loved the palate!  Silky in my mouth, lightly carbonated, easy to drink, really nice slightly hoppy/bitter finish.

6672,"Cloudy mahogany with good, creamy tan head / Big bread and malt  nose / Full body, sweet and malty with good finish / Cooked flavors of banana, chocolate, and grape / Stale flavors detract.
",5
6673,"Poured an amber brown body filled with particles, all under an average tan head. Smelled of lightly roasted malts and grains, and some hoppy herbs and grass. Nice taste of slightly sour apples, moving to the bitter grass and roses youd expect from the hops, a nice spice throughout. Average on the palate, slightly oily texture. Ill stick with Chimay Blue unless Im looking for the hop bite.
",5
6674,"Appearance: Pours a murky, mahogany-hued body with an inch of fizzy, off-white head.		Smell: Dark caramelized malts with a touch of treacle, dark fruits, toasted bread, and spice.		Taste: Toasty dark malts with a caramel sugar sweetness and light dusting of spice. Slight breadiness. Vinous fruit character with flavors of plums and golden raisins, though it develops a stronger banana taste upon warming. Fleeting hint of cocoa powder. Brief yeastiness. Finishes a bit sweetness with a final cocoa-fruit mix.		Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Well carbonated.		Drinkability: Pretty good! Nice complexity and fairly well-balanced. In fact, the whole Chimay family is very solid and overall enjoyable.
",5
6675,"Bottle. Bubblegum, figs, cherries, grapes, and light banana aromas. Cloudy orange-red with a thin head. Flavor is clean with raisin and candy notes. Bubblegum and spice. Good balance. Thick and chewy with moderate carbonation.

Pours an exhuberant, short lived head, with minimal lacing, over a reddish amber body....nose of sweet malts. some yeast with a bit of grapefruit....tastes of malts, over all rather dryer than expected, finish is of mild hops.....mouthfeel is very light. I know this is true to the style, and very well balanced, but I am afraid I am not that much of a fan of dubbels given my scoring. Such is the burden of the beerista.
",5
6680,"Good head on pour which settled doen to a 2mm coating after a couple of minutes. Dark orange/ brown translucent colour with visable yeast remnants (Couldnt wait to let it settle.) Enjoyable yeasty flavour with sweet suagry feel. Recommended as a winter slow drinking/ appreciating beer.
",5
6681,"Presentation: It was poured from a stubby brown 11.2oz bottle into a signature Chimay chalice that came with the gift set.		Appearance: It has a deep burgundy color with reddish amber highlights. The body has a light haze with a few small bits of yeast suspended in the liquid just above the bottom of the chalice. Its head builds up tall and thick with a creamy off white colored head. The head slowly recedes to a thin wispy covering that hangs on tell the finish and even leaves behind a small amount of lace.		Smell: The aroma has a pleasing dark sweet malt character with lots of good fruity esters and earthy Belgian yeast. There is a slight phenolic presence as well.		Taste/Mouth feel: There is a good sweet malty body that is full of fruity notes like apricot, dates and plums that mixes with some earthy yeast. In the middle there is a very slight astringency. It also has some light herbal hops spice and a pleasant alcohol that adds depth and warmth. In the finish the sweetness fades off giving way to dry earthy yeast. The texture is smooth with a slid medium to full body and well balanced carbonation.		Notes: This is a very solid Trappist Dubbel and an absolute joy to drink.

6682,"I tasted this beer before I got my account with ratebeer, so I cant really remember all the flavors.
",5
6683,"750 mL bottle. Not as good as I remember this being first time I tried it a year ago. Pours a dark hazy orange with a two finger tan head. No lacing though... Nose is flowers, cloves, dried apricot. Taste is like a witbier dunkel if one existed: bananas, spice, yeast, and a tang of citrus hops plus some brown sugar and alcohol notes. Long, neutral, bubbly finish that brings out some chocolate covered raisins. Excellent, but I remember it being so much more.

6691,"UPDATED: OCT 26, 2008 33 cl bottle. Pours hazy copper to amber with a medium white head. Malty aroma is somewhat hoppy, spicy and a bit yeasty. Dark, sweetish fruity aromas are close to wine gums. Somethng like raisins or dates, maybe also plums. Flavor is something from sweetish to sour: fermented fruits, dark caramelly malts and yeast. The finish is lightly bitter but not dry. Theres something faint but delicious in the finish that literally makes my mouth water. Palate is soft, medium bodied and a bit thin.

",5
6695,"From a 12 oz bottle.  Deep brown/red with a bubbly white head.  Fruity and smoky.  Malty in its own right, not so much as the Blue, more of a smoky malt flavor.  Great balance.  One of the better dubbels out there (from the few Ive had so far).

Effervescent bump of faint cherry and mineral with slightly dry finish.

6699,"Cloudy to the max, medium brown with a small tan blotchy head.  Fades quickly.  Aroma is yeast galore and fruit.  Flavors of, again, yeast, peach, pear, apples.  As it warms peppery spices show up that offers a nice addition.  What a good beer!
",5
6700,"Finally get a chance to do the notorious red. Bottle at the Hop House in Carnegie for $6.50. Very sparkley appearance. Hazy light brown. Good clean near candy aroma.  Taste is rather strong and it doesnt hide its alky content well. Very good creamy bubbly carbonation on the palate. Not as refined as many other belgie dubs Ive had. Acceptable, none the less. Finish is a little coarse and difficult at times, somewhat like a strong ale.

6707,"Nice de750 ml bottle. Nice aroma upon opening. Color is deep amber with some cloudiness from yeast. Aroma has a lot going on. Im getting strong maltiness mixed in with some dark fruity esters such as raisin and/or dates. There are also some spicy phenols in the background, but not overpowering. Tastes very nicely balanced between malt, esters and spice. Very easy on the palate. Not as thick as expected. Overall, a top notch dubbel.

6710,"Location: 33 ml bottle from Costco in Richmond, 9/24/11			Aroma: The nose is fairly sweet, with caramel malts, some dark fruits, Belgian yeast, and spice		Appearance: The pour is a cloudy dark orange-brown with a thick and creamy, lasting, lacy beige crown		Flavor: The taste is medium sweet, with a Belgian yeast, roasted caramel malts, and some fruity notes		Palate: The body is medium-full with a creamy and chewy mouthfeel, and soft-to-average carbonation		Overall Impression: 	Its fairly surprising to see that I got all the way to rating 1885 before entering one for Chimay Red, but somehow I managed.  I like this beer, but I dont really tend to order/buy it very often for some reason, but when I walked into Costco and saw this 3 pack (Red, White, and Blue) + a glass offering for like $12 I couldnt resist.  Thats a heck of a deal!  So, I, of course, enjoyed this one in my new Chimay glass.  This one is so easy to find, that it probably doesnt the respect it deserves, but it is a really good beer.  I wont hold its accessability against it, if anything, that should be a plus, becuase they make so much of it and they still make it so well.  It is about time that I got around to inputing a rating for this one, and I look forward to getting new/updated versions of the other two up here soon.

",5
6728,"Im sad I didnt get to try this by itself. Someone had it at a homebrewers meeting and I tried it but it was one of the last beers I tried, along with all that great homebrew. I didnt realy get to experiance the totality of the Chimay Red. It was good is all I can remember or say.
",1
6729,"Pours a rich mahogony color from the bomber with a thick off-white head of foam.  Loaded with yeast, raisin, and hops in the nose with notes of caramel in the flavor.  A bit too high in water content for my taste, but a respectable beer all the same.
",5
6730,"Bottle from Oddbins.  Very effervescent and this makes it almost impossible to pour clear.  No matter, it still looks great.  Initially large off-white head fades rapidly to a thin veneer.  Yeast and rich raisin fruit in the nose.  Theres a surprisingly complex bitterness and sweetness that eventually reveals an intense spiciness.  Very mellow lasting finish.  Like the Blue, adding the sediment gives an extra dimension.  This beer is an absolute joy.

6732,"Bottle.  Pours a cloudy brown with massive head.  Aromas are fruity, yeasty and sweet.  Flavor is pretty darn nice, but mouthfeel is thinner than I expected.

6738,"UPDATED: NOV 7, 2009 [rerate] Finally got around to drinking an entire bottle of this.  Much better flavor and palate than I remember from the sample at alefest.  Very nice dubbel!				Bottle sampled at Dayton Ale Fest.  Dark brown color with a fairly thick head.  Not much lacing.  Extremely drinkable Belgian brew but not the most complex.  Its pretty hard to compare this one to the Chimay Blue.  Still, has nice sweet flavors of raisins and other fruit with slight yeasty aromas and flavors as well.  Pretty dry finish.

6739,"750ml bottle from By the Bottle in Vancouver, WA--Poured a rich, ruby-chestnut body with a full beige head.  Yeastiness, hoppiness, and sweet maltiness prevailed on this beer.

6751,"Initial taste is of old nickels. After the first few sips, the fruit essence comes through and a creamy body balances everything out. This is a good beer indeed, though a little overrated in my opinion. Still, very enjoyable and recommended.

6757,"Wonderful, distinctive beer. I like the fruity notes in the aroma, and in the overall taste. I think the beer is malty enough to balance out the fruitiness very nicely. Looks all amber loveliness in the tumbler. Just a splendid beer.
",5
6758,"What more can I say about this classic? It has a nice sweetness to it and some light yeastiness with lots of dark fruits churning around. The fruits sweetness comes out more with warmth. A very pleasant beer, too bad it costs so much.
",5
6759,"Wow.  Just realized I have never rated this beer.  Chimay was really my first introduction to Belgian beers... in Amsterdam 11 years ago.  Always a favorite, but one that I dont drink nearly enough.  Lovely bready, yeasty nose with strong apricot and almond paste aromas.  Really lovely.  Some darker fruits and malts on the palate, and a bit of alcohol considering its only 7%.  Often has some metallic notes which detract a bit, but I do love this beer.

6760,"Bottle. Big frothy haed. Hazy brown-amber color. Soft aroma of marzipan, vanilla, apricots and roses. Just a hint of smokiness and almonds. Clean fresh slightly sweet and creamy mouthfeel. Just a hint of warming alcohol and some bitterness in the end. Very drinkable.

6766,"Bottle, Legendary Lancs Heroes, Crosby. How does this stuff rate so high? I remenber being underwhelmed by this back in my early days of belgian berer tasting in 2003, but thought Id give it another chance....Reddy brown colour, looked quite appealing. Malty aroma. Flavour had some fruit and spice.Creamy mouthfeel mixed with an unpleasant carbonation that is just wrong.  Dont believe the hype ! NOT a great beer.
",1
6767,"33cl bottle from Vinmonopolet. It poured a reddish-brown colour with a medium white head that settled down fast in the glass. The aroma smells of wheats and malts. The flavour is dry and bitter and tastes of raisins, malts, alcohol and caramels. It has a short aftertaste.
",5
6768,"No doubt, a great beer, but strange undertones of wheat beer, which is great unless you hate wheat beer, as I do. Chimay Blue did not leave me with this feeling.
",1
6769,"Chimay red This ale pours an amber colour with a thin tan head good carbonation supprisingly hoppy aroma thin mouthfeel and an unusual crispnesss for a belgian the 7% abv must have something to do with it as I am more accustomed to the triples and abbeys.so needless to say it lacks some of the more winey alchohol presence, not a bad thing. Biscuity sweet malt finish fruity hop aroma very drinkable. While I find most belgians to be one and done because of the body and abv this lighter crisper example is very easily followed by a second and third. I did notice a slight mettalic taste near the end of the bottle when the yeast sediment was more prevalent. Not in a bad way just a hint on the finish.
",5
6770,"bottle from monooly outlet, oslo.	Pours hazy brown with creamy tan head. Weizen-like aromas with yellow fruits. Kinda dry, but still fruity. Some sweetness in the end.

6771,"Not bad at all.  Actually, I thought it was similar to Chimay Blue.  Where I live, this is a very common beer, so I know bars where I can get it regularly.

Very different than the gold, still havent tried the blue.

6779,"Pours a murky orange/brown with a lovely creamy off-white fluff on top.   Sweet doughy malt aroma, yeasty, some apples and pears.

6782,"11.2 ounce bottle-  poured out red-gold and cloudy with a firm off-white head.  Aroma wasnt much of anything except yeast.  There was a good 1/4 inch of sediment in the bottle.

6792,"Although typically the least expensive of the red, white and blue Chimays, this is my favourite, perhaps since it was the first one I tried and the one I have the most experience with. Sweet, spicy, fruity and woody scent. The colour is my favourite type among beers - a very cloudy copper with a nice fluffy off-white head that settles to a nice thin layer with some lacing, but not that much. Taste is malty, a bit spicey-fruity with a bit of a bitter edge, but no noticeable alcohol. Ends with a bit of a long, but smooth bitterness. Manages to come off as light but not watery. Extremely drinkable.

Sweet malts in the aroma and a little hint of fruitiness.  Medium mouth feel.  The taste was malted, slightly nutty, bitter, and with a hint of hops. A dryer finish. The alcohol is more prevalent in the flavor than in the aroma.  I understand why its gets a decent rating.  Not my style exactly but definitely a good brew.
",5
6797,"25 ounce bottle.  Pours a nice red-amber color with a good siezed beige head that lasts.  Taste is fruity and yeasty, while the aroma is fruity and of caramel.  Has a pretty good mouthfell, that makes me want more.  Overall, this is a pretty excellent beer as it is rather tasty, easy to drink, and for the quality it is priced fairly (About $4.75 per 25 ounce bottle).  Also, I like the bottle and label design.
",5
6798,"I cant write anything about Chimay that the previous 2000 reviewers havent already said.  Great beer, but IMO, its worth the extra couple of bucks to buy the blue or white instead of the red.  With that said, the red is still world class.

6799,"Bottle looks really simple but really good. Beer in the glass light brown, small head. Spicy-roasty aroma. Starts mild, almost a bit washy. Gets more and more moldy-malty. Finish a bit more warming, but still milder than exspected. I exspected more and I am a bit disappointed.

6815,"UPDATED: JAN 20, 2010 Bottle. This beer looks and smells decadent. If rating on that beautiful mahogany pour or the smells of ripe, dark fruit, this would be perfect. Drank this at the bar and it was still a little cold from the fridge, which seemed to mask the slight plum, raisins, grape, and prune taste I was getting. Nice subtle alcohol warmth at the end. Need to drink this a little warmer.		Re-rate, 1/20/2010 - Bottle - Dropped aroma from 10 to a 6. Not sure what I was thinking before. Still a nice beer, but way too hot. Masks some luscious flavors lingering below. Have a bottle in the cellar thats a year old. Will probably take it out in a year to see if that heat has subsided.

6821,"Pours a tan creamy head that lingers.  Very dark in low light but when held up to a light, it reveals a remarkable ruby color.  Aroma of figs, molasses, toffee.  Taste is smooth, creamy...starts with taste of dates/raisins and fades to a malty-caramel sweet finish, ending with a touch of hoppy bitterness.  High ABV is well masked, only a slight warming sensation.  One of the finest beers Ive ever had.

6822,"It pours a nice deap dark brown with a light tan head.  Wonderfull aromas with a blend of fruits and malts.  Its taste is well ballance bettwen its sweetness of brown sugars, fruits and caramellized hops.  One of the most flavorfull and pleasant beers to drink.  Must take the time to enjoy this delicasy.

6824,"unclear brown w nice head. Strong malty aroma of dark fruit, caramel and spices. Alcolhol develops in mouth. Flavour is sweet and the long finish sweet too. Never go wrong with Chimay Bleu
",5
6825,"Brown in color with  beige head. Aroma and taste is of prune, malt, chocolate, and yeast.  This is one of the best very widely distributed beers.

6830,"750ml first pour in Westmalle glass.  (Chimay glass is dirty.)  Hazy dark brown with lasting flat head.  Caramel cherry wood and fresh damp forest growth aroma.  Toasty caramel woodsy yeasty mild fruit with surprisingly clean finish.  Medium-full creamy body and rather bubbly internal carbo despite fairly rousing pour.  Just plain delicious.  Everything balanced to please the palate.  Only a little too cold.  Gotta let it sit...but I...cant...stop...drinking...it!

6831,"Pours a nice dark brown cola color with a nice big head of foam.		Aroma is nicely that of a good Trappist.  Reminds of a Rochefort 10.		Interesting flavor.  Very mild for a beer, nice and yeasty with roasted malt.  Subtle.  Not what I expected, considering the high standing of this beer.

6832,"Muddy brown, maybe orange with lots of yeast particles. Aroma is of sweet malts. Tastes like bitter chocolate. Alcohol slightly noticeable. Not very complex taste but good nonetheless.
",5
6833,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2009 Appearance is murky brown with a fine foam head of about 10% the height of the rest of the beer.  The correct temperature certainly brings out the best parts of this beer.  I brought home the bottle and placed it in my fridge for a little less than an hour before drinking, and this proved to be perfect.  Wonderfully creamy with hints of yeast, caramel, and just a little metallic carbonation.  Underneath the surface, theres a feeling of incredible clarity that lasts in the middle of the tongue.  All in all, a great experience.

6834,"Had many a time, but rating from a vintage 3L magnum had at my going-away party at Brouwers. Lovely deep, still pour. Bright carbonation on a caramel, sweet malt base. yeast, dark fruit, dark chocolate. Not an Abt but very nice.

A bit like dunkel weissbiers from Mnich. Big dissapointment.	Bottle 2008 edition. Dark brown colour with a thin beige head. Aroma and taste dark sugars, flower, yeast and dried fruit. Bitter finish. Tasted along with St.Bernadus Abt12 on the side. Abt12 being so much more of everything and longer finish. Chimay being a dissapointment.

6840,"Multiple samples over time. Pours dark brown with receding tan head. Nose has mostly caramelized sugar with subdued dark fruit. Sweetish flavor with backdrop of mostly dark sugar, mild bitterness. Lively mouthfeel with relatively clean aftertaste, compared to what youd expect from this sort of strong, dark ale. Still an immediately tasty beer, very likable, just not as contemplative as some of its cousins.
",5
6841,"Bottle from t Brugs Beertje.  Very nice beer.  Dark brown with a good head.  Like other strong Belgian beers it hides its alcohol very well.  When compared to the other Trappists I prefer Rochefort, but still very good.

6842,"UPDATED: JAN 3, 2011 Dont bother with smaller bottles when it comes to the Chimay trilogy.. more than most beers 750mls are essential with Chimay. Chocolate,malt, floral grapefruit,dank suggestions & the type of  spices that are probably illegal unless youre a Monk and pray all day.

6843,"Dgust avec french tickler le 10 octobre 20006.	750ml Bottled in May 2003. This was aged over 3 years in my beer cellar. Fantastic looking beer... small yeast deposits at the bottom of bottle. Caramel, Nutty, Wildberries, cassis, Dates completes the aroma. Light red wine taste to it... i almost feel like if this beer would of aged maybe 5 years it taste closed to a porto. Fantastic finish, this beer ages amazingly well!
",5
6844,"Had this beer once a few years ago. Wasnt into the stronger dark beers at the time, but surprisingly liked this beer. Its no wonder it is one of the top rated.
",5
6845,"Smells library and sweet. All sorts of things going on in the flavor. Grapey, leathery, marmalade, Keeps going back and forth between sweet and earthy, musty and bright. Feels like whipped cream. Just dissolves. 		Not my favorite flavor, but love how it melts in your mouth.
",5
6846,"Bottle@home, 1999 vintage (!)		Apperance: Ruby red with almost no head. Liquid is quite clear.		Aroma: Earth, Ripe fruit, Port wine. Very sweet and inviting!		Flavor: Dark caramel, Port wine, Ripe fruit, Hint of alcohol and some coffee.		Palate: Very sweet and delicious with a medium body. Very little carbonation but still enough.		When you smell this beer you could swear that it is a port wine you have before you. The taste is similar to portwine but the body is quite alot thinner. This beer has aged with beauty and it was indeed interesting to see what 10 years could do to a beer.
",5
6847,"Absolutely marvelous.  The flavor is perfectly balanced with just enough sweetness and just enough hoppiness.  This is in spite of the high ABV.  Thank God for trappists.
",5
6848,"Excellent beer. Very smooth and not too harsh from the high alcohol content. A rich, malty taste with subtle fruit flavor. Pairs amazingly well with pork loin or country ribs.
",5
6849,"Strong yeast in the aroma, otherwise a malty, chocolate nose. Sweetness of golden syrup and some fruitiness like peach. 	Spicy flavours, peppery at first but turns slightly toward aniseed and allspice. Some yeast in the flavours.	The alcohol is obvious, but along with the spice it adds warmth (not like I need this right now, seeing as its 30 degrees C outside...).	Some fruit in there like red grapes and dark plum, as well as hints of raisin and caramel. 	A hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste which is nice. Great ale.
",5
6850,"pours a dark brown with no foam. nice alcohol content. liked the chimay red better personally.
",5
6851,"Pours deep burgundy brown with off white head.  The aroma is slightly meaty, funky and of dark fruit.  My smelling experience was somewhat ruined by another taster saying it reminded him of the smell of dead mice he feeds his pet snake.  The flavor is sweet, complex with notes of various spices I cant yet name.  The palate is velvety, warming, and bubbly.  Overall this is a very nice beer, but the spice/funk thing is not quite my thing.  It may need more time.
",5
6852,"UPDATED: NOV 8, 2009 one of my favourites, 	Pours a dark brown with dark tan head. Aroma of yeast, alcohol, spice and malts. 	The flavour is sweet ,fruity and then the taste of strong alcohol kicks in.	excellent beer , but could not drink  more then one bottle.
",5
6853,"1989 bottle courtesy of bierkoning vs. a fresh bottle.  Both pour a ruddy brown with a thin off white head.  The 89 head dies out instantly though.  89 has a big malty aroma, dark fruits mix with light signs of age like apple cider vinegar and light oxidation.  Strong alcohol and a flat feel.  The fresh bottle has the same maltiness and prunes, other dark fruit and caramel but hides the alcohol better.  Both were fantastic, the edge goes to the fresh bottle but at 20 years young the old bottle is still kicking.

6854,"espuma de aparncia inicial portentosa e cremosa, colorao marrom-claro e curta longevidade. Seu corpo apresentou tons marrom-claros, densidade mdia, turbidez e moderada formao de colarinho. No aroma, farejei algumas coisas que no esperava, como a suave presena de caf, notas ctricas lembrando lima, bala toffee e frutas vermelhas - a bela complexidade de uma BSA. No campo do sabor, o incio foi permeado por leves dulor e amargor, sensaes estas que foram suplantadas por moderado amargor no final, este de curta durao. Percebi ainda um marcante toque de frutas secas no paladar, o que aumentou sobremaneira o charme dessa deliciosa cerveja. No paladar, fui premiado com um corpo mdio-cheio, de textura oleosa, forte carbonatao e forte final metlico
",5
6855,"11.2 oz small bottle.  No date.  Into Chimay glass.  Rich brown with some red hue with a light tan head that starts big but fades fast to an 8th of an inch and holds - no lace.  Aroma is pretty solid and very typical of the style - sweet candy, vanilla, dough, dark fruity (like plums), some booze and licorice, and yeast.  The flavor is the same but a bit less yeasty and just a bit better in general.  Not overly sweet like many Belgians, but still sweet.  Chimay hides the alcohol pretty well in this one, though it does heat the stomach pretty noticeably.  Medium to light bodied with over-the-top carbonation like most other Belgians, all of which I am not a huge fan of.  Overall: a solid brew, but wouldnt want more than one (or even more than about 8 ounces).  A generally over-hyped overrated style IMO -- I just dont get much complexity or sense much drinkability from it, and a good style has to have one or the other.
",5
6856,"one of my favourites, the bottle I have was from 2006 (not sure on ideal length to age it, anyone?)  Regardles is a great beer, nice light fruity aroma.  MAlts give a nice sweetness(but not overly so)  to go along with caramel and slight spiciness.Carbonation is low (almost like a cask)  Very easy dirinking and very tasty
",5
6857,"UPDATED: JAN 30, 2009 Bottle. Pours a dark brown with dark tan head. Aroma of yeast, alcohol, spice and malts. Light and fizzy on the palate with a heavy malt taste with a nice bite. I have to agree with others who are reminded of barley wine, although its not quite as heavy. A good brew none the less.

6861,"Definitely a pleasant experience, not what one would expect from such a tiny, understated bottle.  Doesnt taste like any 9% beer.   NIce aroma, great muddy brown appearance and the flavour is a fine and sweet.
",5
6862,"330 ml bottle. Finland.	Very dark hazy brown with massive fluffy head. Yesterday I tasted the Triped (Blanche) and I was expecting something even better. Well, I do not know. I think Tripel was more flavoured. Here is a more alcohol present. Still excellent!
",5
6863,"Once, an older relative produced a bottle of Chimay blue he had smuggled back from France - it was a mighty 9%!!! Of course we tried and hated it. Now of course its like a nectar of the gods - A murky chocolaty body, swirling with fine bubbles, a fine tan head. Flavours of port wine, sweet Arabian spices, autumn fruit and rich dark cocoa. The alcohol works well with these robust flavours, warming the palate gently. Its always reassuring that a beer as readily available as this still lives up to its reputation as a world classic.
",5
6864,"Yeasty, sugary notes dominate the aroma.  It pours a very dark amber, almost brown, and indeed the malt resembles a brown ale.   The flavor is sweet and yeasty with some floral notes.  Weighty texture with some alcohol notes.  Yeast and sugar dominate the palate, not entirely to its benefit.   I am probably signing my sentence to Hell by not writing a rave review of the Trappist efforts, but I am underwhelmed.  Both the Premiere and Cinq Cents are better balanced.

Highly drinkable with candi sugar and a fruity ester present clearly from the yeast strain used in the fermenting process. Not overly high in the cloves coriander category which I love about this beer and seems to have just enough of everything to give it that distinct Belgianest flavor Ive come to love and appreciate over the years. A classic for sure..

The monks do things right in Belgium.

6882,"Chimay is the most commercial of the Trappist beers...this can be found in many stateside specialty stores.  It comes in Bleue, Rouge, and Blanc...decending in alcohol content.  The Bleue is by far the best of the three..but the taster must like strong flavored ales.  Very good beer, but 4 or 5 will cause you to hate yourself in the morning.

6883,"This dark, cloudy ale does not boast any overwhelming flavors. Instead, it provides a deep, smooth sensation that seemingly could even complement a meat dish. Hints of chocolate are present along with alcohol. Leaves a great aftertaste.
",5
6884,"Presentation: It was poured from a stubby brown 11.2oz bottle into a signature Chimay chalice that came with the gift set.		Appearance: The body has a beautiful deep dark brown colored body with dark ruby highlights and a slightly hazy body. The head builds up tall and thick with an abundance of small tiny, tight packed bubbles. It has a creamy off white color and good retention as it slowly settles down to a light thin covering. Lacing is very slick and minimal.		Smell: The aroma has an intoxicating mix of sweet malt, earthy yeast and dark fruity esters.		Taste/Mouth feel: Ageing only adds more complexity and character and each sip will reveal different flavor notes. To start there is a nice lightly roasted, almost smoky malt with different layers of dark fruits that is revealed as it warms. Plums, figs, dates, dark and golden raisins are some fruits I noted and all is surrounded buy the presence of a pleasant warming port like alcohol. Its palate is full and well rounded with a smooth feel and mellow carbonation.		Notes: For me this is about as close to perfect as a beer could be. It is an absolute pleasure for all the senses.

6887,"This is a dark brownish-gold Belgian, with a thin cappuccino head. It smells like fig, caramel, candy sugar, cherries and yeast, which may sound odd but is actually captivating. Unsurprisingly, theres a lot of candy sugar in the taste, as well as roses, plums, molasses, and nutty malt.

6889,"This is simply one of the best beers in the world that everyone shouldve tried. The dark colour, with the amber touch, great strong head that doesnt dissapear and the great aroma is only the startup to a great beer experience. Its a beer to combine with a nice steak or Belgium stew, or to drink on its own in the evening with some cheese. Its a heavy bittersweet taste, with a smooth aftertaste. One of the better abbey beers.

6890,"Ooooh mercy! This is one dark ale that needs to be on everyones taste list! This brew poured up a dark root-beer brown colored body sporting a huge frothy off-white colored head with good retention (slowly dissipating down to a thin sheen) and amazing lacing effects. Aromas of figs, dark cherries, sweet malts, pine nuts, cloves and spices (like nutmeg, cinnamon, etc.). The flavors are of the same but oh so complex  each sip has its own reward and it gets much better as the beer warms. Medium- to Full-bodied, ultra smooth, slow carbonation with a finish that is dry and you will definitely know that there is some alcohol in this one! Definitely a brew to pair with a slow-grilled juicy steak!

6893,"No better way to obliterate the stagnant memories of an otherwise unfulfilling day than by putting back a bottle of strong Belgian beer. This stuff looks good, really dark brown with your typical cottony Belgian foam. Alcohol and roasty spice & a little ripe fruit in the aroma. Taste is nice, a little bit of booze fumes tickle your sinuses as you get some roasty, rich malt flavor polished off by a little zing that I can only compare to grapeskins, if that makes any sense. Its got just a little dash of sweet but not in a bad way, it leaves the palate pretty clean and doesnt build up in an unpleasant syrupiness at all.  Great beer to have with a steak.  This is a world-class brew that everyone should try.

6909,"Brown/Burgundy in color with a somewhat small but long lasting head. The aroma is all esters and yeast, smells like the good parts of aging fruit. Flavor is similar with prunes/cherries and dark candi sugar flavor. Mouthfeel is thick and protein-rich

6910,"UPDATED: APR 28, 2010 what an amazing brew pour was brown and clody aromas of yeast alcohol and malts taste was of alcohol,raisen bread and choclates and alot more very complex as iI lokked in to tmy glass it was blowing smoke rinngs that continely rose from the bottom smooth and sweet can not wait for the next one

6911,"330ml bottle. Pours dark brown with burgundy highlights. Small, fizzy head. Smells dark and sweet malty with a good dose of alcohol. RIpe dark fruit scent as well. Tastes dark, ripe fruity malty, raisins. Some alcohol as well. Medium body, thoroughly coats the mouth, fizzy carbonation.
",5
6912,"330ml bottle into a Delirium tulip.		Pours a dark, ruby-rimmed brown. Insane head lasts for almost the whole glass, but leaves surprisingly little lacing. Beautiful nose on this thing. Plum, raisin, anise, coriander, and a hint of booze. The dark fruits and spice form a perfect balance on the palate. Wonderful. Medium mouthfeel. Crisp carbonation, but not too bubbly to prevent the flavor from lingering. Very drinkable.		theres a reason that Chimay is the first thing people think when they hear the word Trappist, and this is it. A must try for any beer lover.

6913,"A very good Belgian ale. Complex, the yeast is more floral than ester. Very pretty to pour.

6915,"Bottle. Dark brown colour with a large head. Aroma of malts, fruits and yeast. The flavour is sweet, malty, fruity and a bit  toffeeish. Mediuml-bodied, alcohol is hidden well. Nice and complex brew.

6916,"Courtsey of Tony @ OTH.	Pours brown/amber, with brownish head.	Aroma, filled with dark fruits and sugar.	Taste, dark druits (cherry / prune) and malty. Los of sugar / licorice sweetness.	Excellent balance, close to a Westie12, a little darker in content and texture.	This is a big beer, very drinkable, a good sipper, gets better as it warms up.
",5
6917,"Nice hazy brown color. Arma includes alcohol, yeast and spices. Flavor is also spicy with hints of liquorice. Very complex brew that tends to grow on you.
",5
6918,"UPDATED: DEC 8, 2008 Lives up to its fancy bottle and big reputation.  Big crisp aroma of brown sugar, dark fruit, and yeast.  Flavor is sweet and malty, and never musty.  Definitely worth a try, if only for the great looks and superior mouthfeel.
",5
6919,"From bottle to Trappist Glass.  Pours dark brown with no head.  Smells of Fruits and candies.  Taste was strong with heavy sugars and coffee.  Some Chocolate and then an alcohol aftertaste.  Over all, pretty good beer.
",5
6920,"This is one of those beers that just gets better the closer to the bottom of the glass you get. The spicy pepper sensation at the end blows me away every time. Heavy brown sugar flavor early on and the alcohol comes to the top a little but not in an obtrusive manner. Very very tasty.
",5
6921,"Brown pour, hazy with a light tan head.  Chocolate and alcohol aroma.  Chocolate malt flavor with some alcohol on the finish.  Very mellow and easy to drink despite the alcohol content.  Didnt think it was really anything special.

6922,"Bottle, thanks ekstedt. Dark reddish brown with off-white head. Fruity aroma of raisins. Sweetish taste. Full mouthfeel with fizzy carbonation.
",5
6923,"overall very good. Small hint of alcohol aftertaste. Best flavor as beer warms towards bottom of glass.
",5
6924,"Small bottle pured into stemless snifter.  Nose is rich so much going on.  Dark fruits as well as sun dried fruits.  Some chocolate, smoke, leather.  Flavors of raisins dominate.  Dark roasted malt, coffee chocolate, somewhat thick palate.  Nice caramely bitter finish.
",5
6925,"Dark brown body with a medium, receding tan head. A floral, and fruity aroma with sugar, a hint of alcohol, and roasted malt. The flavour is sweet, has dark fruit, pepper. Alcohol is evident but subtle. Some nuttiness in the aftertaste as well as fruit. Medium to full bodied and carbonaceous.There is a lot to it, but it is very balanced.
",5
6926,"Dark brownish colour with no head.Aroma is sweet and fruity with smooth well balanced mouth feels.Flavor of brown sugar and raisins.Vinous and soft finish.
",5
6927,"25 oz bottle at Zenos.  Pretty dark brown pour with a creamy lacing.  Deep aroma of chestnuts, figs, toffee, and caramel.  Rich and smooth.  Nice, rich flavor, exploding with the figs.  Soft, carbonation, a little boozy.  An awesome brew and a great bottle...I think this one had at least a year on it.
",5
6928,"Very cloudy medium brown with a smallish tan head.  A musty aroma that is not appealing.  Flavor is yeast and dark fruit, apple sauce caramel, and alcohol.  Very interesting and very good.
",5
6929,"UPDATED: FEB 23, 2009 Pours a frothy tan head which diminishes but has good lacing. The reddish brown body held tiny particles which swirled and begged me to drink them. The smell was a tantalizing array of fruits, but the burnt caramel and toffee were the leading scents, some rising yeast as well. Burnt toffee was again apparent in the taste, as well as roasted malt and fermenting fruit on the sides of the tounge. It doesnt mask the alcohol well, its true, but still a delicious creation! Light and oily on the palate, soft carbonation, slight alcoholic aftertaste. This is a classic.
",5
6930,"UPDATED: JAN 8, 2009 Fantastic beer! Aroma is full of yeast and flowers, slight cigar in the background. Pours an almost perfect deep brown, with amber hues. Flavor is smooth and balanced, lots of yeast and some malt. Goes down great. This one is a great, great beer.
",5
6931,"Pours a cloudy deep, dark reddish-brown color with a thick, frothy off-white head. Had the aroma of walking through a vineyard taking in the sweetness of the grapes and the earthiness of the soil. The flavor is a wonderful balance of roasted malt, wine, prunes, apple, bread, and a nice touch of light bitterness. There is some underlying alcohol but it fits in perfectly with the array of flavors and generous carbonation. This is a very nice beverage.
",5
6932,"Thanks to Pollo.  A Complex Classic.  ""This aromatic lively rich ale has a medium sweet middle, with gently drier suggestions of thyme, pepper, sandalwood, and nutmeg in the finish.""	MJ
",5
6933,"Finally rated from a sample at WBF in Durham, though I expect to have this again.  I love all Chimay beers.  This one is vinous, with a deep copper pour and foamy, generous off-white head.  Stewed fruits such as raisins and prunes.  Some peat flavor and herbs, earthiness.  Very good.

6934,"Esta es la pura belga. Esta muy buena, entera y redonda con buen sabor y final. Digna representante de esta categoria. Rica
",5
6935,"Pours dark brown with a small but attractive and long lasting head. Little aroma but I do have a cold!. Nice carbonation. Warming, malty taste with herbs, caramel and flowers. Raisins and scotch whisky also present. Alcoholic finish. No bitterness whatsoever. Would go for Rochefort 8 instead. Fair comparison though.
",5
6936,"Bottle 33cl 2007 vintage. Dark brown brew, lively carbonation. Qickly disappearing white head. Taste: dark malts, brown candis, alcohol, dark dried fruits, slightly sour. Unharmonic but massive due to to high alcohol. There are better trappists.
",1
6937,"Damn Good.  Thats all I can remember, this was the first beer I tried at beerfest in Orlando yesterday.  My rankings from Beerfest are as follows, Damn Good, Good, Alright, Bad, Runaway.
",5
6938,"From the first smell to the flavors rushing over my tongue is impressive. I cant believe beer can be this good!
",5
6939,"Reddish brown. Nice white airy head. Slight fruity aroma. Refreshing. Crisp and clean. Sits on the tongue just right. Bubbly on the tongue
",5
6940,"Bottle. Ruby Red in color.  Pours a good sized tan head than diminishes fairly fast. Some spotty lacing. Got a good whiff of alcohol in the aroma along with some yeast and fruit. Flavor starts of sweet with raisin and caramel ends with a some spice and a bit or an alcohol burn.  Rather smooth beer overall.I prefer the Rochefort 8 over this one though.
",5
6941,"Pours rootbeer color with slowly-dissipating light tan head and good lacing.  Aroma of alcohol and hardwood.  Flavor is sweet with much alcohol and some walnut-husk bitterness, hints of red table wine.  Lots of body, finishes with some plum and raspberry.  Would buy again.
",5
6942,"Bottle 33cl.	2008. Pours a muddy brown colour with a good head.	Clear fruity arome, very complex and well balanced.	Taste is also very fruity, goes down with a touch of the alcohol.	Very good beer.
",5
6943,"330ml bottle served in a chalice. Bottle conditioned. Poured a hazy dark amber with a thin off white head. Fruity aroma with some peppery spice. Medium to full bodied with some malt sweetness. Rich mouthfeel. More fruit in the flavor. Spice in the finish and the signature Chimay yeast flavor. A little hop bitterness in the finish as well.
",5
6944,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2009 bottle, pours dark brown with a tall off white head.  Extremely sweet full bodied beer with a rough bitterness that fails to balance all that sugar.  Good, but doesnt do it for me.
",1
6945,"Pours a murky brown with a tall and thick light beige head. Very sweet fruity aroma, scents of Belgian yeast, spices and dark fruits like raisins, maybe some brown sugar/molasses too. Very smooth beer. The fruit comes forth in the beginning, but the long dry finish and the warming in the stomach is the most notable feature. Good if you like elegant, subtle flavor play between the spices and fruit.
",5
6946,"Dark reddish brown,decent head. Apples, raisins, caramel. Alcohol bitterness seems slightly more pronounced that I would like, but still very solid flavor. Nice carbonation, yet smooth. Good beer.
",5
6947,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2010 Re-Rated because I love this fantastic brew even more.  Rich and slightly yeasty.  Reminiscent of baked apples and caramel.  But not too sweet.  Incredibly smooth finish.  Fresh and delicious; an excellent ale.
",5
6948,"UPDATED: SEP 11, 2008 The taste is just pleasant...caramel, some fruity notes, not overly complicated. Sweet but not too sweet. Its nicely carbonated, like fizzy bubbly champagne tickling your tongue. Surprisingly easy drinking.
",5
6949,"(Bottle).  Very fruity aroma.  Dark brown color with substantial head.  Fruity flavor, hints of malt, and the alcohol intrudes a bit.  Sweet finish, but somewhat disappointing in its length.  Quality beer, but I prefer the Chimay Red.
",5
6950,"For beer number 300- I went back to a beer I havent had for awhile. I used to order this at the Dubliner in Omahas Old Market district. The Dubliner was an Irish style cellar pub with a Blarney Stone (every St. Paddys Day youd see inebriated revelers drunkely embracing and smooching it) at the top of the stairs leading to street level, traditional Irish music and an Irish board of fare. 20 years ago, the Dubliner was my preferred bar in Omaha so I revisited this brew to see if was still the way I remembered it.	The aroma is sweet-plums, pears, yeast with a hint of rose or  maybe lilac-Im not sure cant really pin it down.	It has a moderate sweetness with carmelized fruit notes and the alcohol lights you up without a noticeable taste. Velvety mouthfeel and delicate carbonation.	A very fine complex beer (why did I wait 20 years to drink this?)-maybe Ill start bringing it when I tailgate at Arrowhead.	GO CHIEFS!-(see Im an optimist).
",5
6951,"Hard to find a better beer... perfect to share, perfect to taste... an incredible complex sensation... i dont wanna know how much one should pay to get these qualities in a wine... Chimay blue is a lifestyle !
",5
6952,"UPDATED: MAR 8, 2010 (bottle) pours a murky dark red-brown colour with a huge off-white head. aroma is sweet spices, notably cinnamon and cloves, raisin, light aromatic hops and alcohol. flavour has many roasted notes, yeast, wheat, chocolate, alcohol and the same subdued spiciness as in the aroma. medium alcoholic body with mild, lively carbonation and a gentle bitter aftertaste. a flavourful brew, but subtle and shy.
",5
6953,"11.2 oz. bottle. Pours an exuberant head which completely disappears, lovely rich brownish color, nose is hard to identify with multiple layers flowing in, spice, malt, yeast, taste is similar, with yeasts dominating, finish has malt with a bit of hop. I am beginning to think Belgian strongs are my favorite brew style.
",5
6954,"Ahhh, Chimay blue....  Somebody had me drinking this stuff long before I knew anything of belgians.  Great beer, dark reddish brown color with malty aroma and flavor, and some wine like flavors from the yeast.  Amazing.
",5
6955,"Immensely drinkable.  However, my expectations were not quite met.  Pours dark brown with a light head that dissipates almost immediately.  Perhaps the greatest asset of this beer is its impeccable balance, although I was hoping for more of a ""wow"" factor.
",5
6956,"Bottle from Oddbins.  Very effervescent.  Pours deep ruby/brown with off-white head that rapidly diminished.  Winey aroma, malt only hinted at, and a touch of rich, dried fruit.  Smoky, spicy taste, with lots of plummy/raisin fruit - in fact it tastes like its aroma - and a very dry finish.  Relatively light for a 9% beer.  Words of mine cant do justice to this masterpiece.
",5
6957,"750 Bottle - Memphis.  Poured a chestnut brown with a white head, continuously being fed by the bubbles below.  Subtle raison, maybe sweet cherry in the flavor.  VERY dry finish, amazing for a beer that tastes this sweet.
",5
6958,"the best of all three main version, it is strong with lots of fruity malts and a high alcohol content, lots of rich flavors. a must have for the beer snob.
",5
6959,"UPDATED: APR 14, 2009 750 mL bottle. Pours a dark maple, hazy color with visible particulates from the yeast. Huge brown head that goes down quickly. Aroma is very sweet- almost candy. There are tons of cloves in the mix there too. Very creamy going down. Almost like really good spiked apple cider. Alcohol is very nicely covered up by the malts. Yeast flavor permeates until the aftertaste, which is slightly dry and malty.
",5
6960,"Bottle.  Poured a dark brown with a huge brown head.  Aroma of dark fruits and malt.  Flavor shares the sweet malt and dark fruits, with a bitterness at the end.  Creamy on the palate.  Great beer that is overlooked most of the time.
",5
6961,"750 from Fresh Market, Raleigh. Another one of those beers thats so ubiquitous that we beer geeks overlook them in the quest for the new. Dark brown pour with a very vibrant body, lots of carb and an abundant head. Slightly fruity in the aroma, and its there in the flavor too. But this is a sweet malty beer through and through, with a smooth velvety mouthfeel. Just a hint of bitterness comes on late to make things interesting, but this is basically a lush, warming malty beer.
",5
6962,"UPDATED: DEC 9, 2009 Bottle. 25.4 oz. Split with Sean. Pours deep, hazy chesnut brown with a tall, full finger beige head. Aroma of figs, cinnamon, apples, caramel, booze, and hints of roasted malts and chocolate. Fuller bodied with a very smooth, sweet mouthfeel. Crisp, tangy, slow finish. Very well known and deservedly so; Chimay Blue is always reliably great. Highly recommended.
",5
6963,"Bottle.  Pours deep ruby/brown, small tan head with good retention.  Aroma of sweet malts, yeast, brown sugar, and caramel.  Thick mouthfeel; crisp, tart, and dry, with sweet dried fruits, sugar, yeast, and well-hidden alcohol.  Nice lacing.
",5
6964,"Pours Brown, with a tan almost creamy head, sweet ripen fruit aroma, fruity flavour with hints of chocolate, spice & alcohole like finish. If you try it in room temp. you might taste strong raisin flavour, I like this one
",5
6965,"Deep golden pour with an off white head.  Sweet aroma of honey and spices.  Smooth sweet taste with honey and fruits with a good amount of carbonation.  Had an almost frothy finish.
",5
6966,"UPDATED: SEP 19, 2008 bottle 33cl, beautiful darkbrown color, brown creamy rich head, complex palet, strong, a mix of fine herbs, a hint of caramel. Delicious!
",5
6967,"Pours an eerily hazy dark brown, with a significant tan head. Deep fruity nose with a hint of spice, possibly cinnamon. Great combination of hops and malt once it reaches your mouth, keeps every sip interesting. More sweet fruit notes of plum and even some malt int he taste. The alcohol is present as you finish your sip, but its a nice touch.
",5
6968,"Chimay Bleue is charmingly dark brew with rich creamy foam. Aroma is strongly malty and alcoholic. Flavor is combination of yeasty butter, plum and malt. Aftertaste is a balanced harmony of hops and malt and alcohol is warming nicely.
",5
6969,"Dark hazy brown, roasted malts, dark fruits, floral, yesty, little spice, a bit sour, slight hop.
",5
6970,"Hazy brown colour. Pale brown head fast dissappearing. Softy and malty nose. Sweet taste with some prunes. Also some sourness in the taste. Some hoppiness in the end. A small bottle from Alko shop.
",5
6971,"03 magnum thanks to biggreen opened at the Houston BA Tasting.  Pours a brown with a nice tan head.  Nose is of raisins and malt.  Taste is of raisins, malt and some spice.  Mouthfeel is medium with carbonation and some alcohol.  Very nice.
",5
6972,"Nice dark brown color with thick cream and tan head.  Besides the expected dry fruit and malt aroma, their was a hint of brightness, floral or raspberry, and little overt alcohol taste.  Well balanced flavor, smooth with a sweet finish that seemed unbeerlike, but enjoyable.  Happy to serve again.
",5
6973,"This beer isnt very complex in my opinion but it has a very good taste. This beer is certanly one of my favourites!
",5
6974,"Bire brune aux reflets rougetres. Des odeurs de cerises sucres, de levure, de caramel cossais et dalcool sen dgagent. Un got assez complexe, difficile  identifier, on y dtecte toutefois des parcelles de fruits schs; de dattes, de figues et qui nous titillent le palais avec son ct alcoolis, laissant en passant, une lgre amertume plus quagrable.
",5
6975,"UPDATED: SEP 13, 2011 Pours a deep brownish red. Nose and taste is of yeast, floral accents, and roasted malts. IMO a good gateway into the style.

",5
6977,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Snifter.		Appearance: Rich mahogany with thin sustained head.		Aroma: Plum and other dark fruit, with molasses, figs, rum, a hint of cloves and a blast of alcohol.		Taste: Very fruity and a little sweet with plum, figs, molasses and a mild earthiness. Somewhat rum like overall, although the alcohol is not as noticeable as in the smell.		Palate: Moderate carbonation, fairly full body, very smooth and warming. Slightly dry at the end despite the sweet malts.		Overall: Great sipper that has fantastic malt complexity. Very much an archetype for the style.

6978,"AROMA: chocolate, dough, floral	APPEARANCE: red, brown, clear, frothy then minimal	TASTE: light sweetness, medium bitterness, 	PALATE: full body,  creamy, lively, short bitter aftertaste	OVERALL: a fantastic Belgian strong beer that develops character when kept for years in the cellar.

6980,"Small bottle. Poured dark brown with little head that retained. Aroma and flavour is mostly of dark fruits and yeast. Smooth finish.
",1
6981,"33cl bottle. Pours deep russet colour with thick, foamy head. Very light aroma, barely discernible, hints of hops. Taste, however, is a different story: spicy, with tastes of apples and pears - sweet and creamy. Slight sharp aftertaste. A great drink!
",5
6982,"Large bottle bought at Whole Foods, cork says 04/07. Looks like cola! Aroma is malt, figs and dried fruits. Bitter up front with the taste of dried fruit and spice, followed by malt.  Very nice and unique brew.
",5
6983,"330ml Bottle.  Last of my three beer Chimay vertical.  Pours a swamp water muddy brown with one finger cream head and minimal lacing.  Nose is dark fruits, spice, roasted malts.  Taste is much the same with some sugary flavors added. Medium, prickly mouth fee. A bit too sweet for my tastes, but a quality Belgian that I can appreciate its complexity.
",5
6984,"Just about the thickest head Ive ever seen, pours dark brown, tastes like a caramel apple...holy crap, this is a great beer!
",5
6985,"Outstanding. I love the yeasty aroma, the dark brown hue, the tan head rich and thick. I love the malty body and the way it feels in the mouth. I love the way the flavors zip through nutty to fruity to malty --  exceedingly complex. I love the sweet finish, and the lingering aftertaste. Pour me another ... please?
",5
6986,"UPDATED: DEC 10, 2010 08/04/2008 Pours a very dark brown with a thick tan head.  The aroma is very yeasty and malty with a ripen fruit hint to it.  The taste is malty and chocolatey with some sort of roasted nut flavor.  The finish is sweet, almost as if there is a bit of vanilla in it.  This is a great beer.  4.7		Re-rate 12/10/2010:  Just had one of these the other night and realized that my rating was higher than it should be.  The aroma is sweet malts with notes of dark fruit, candied sugar, and belgian yeast.  Palate is sweet, finishing a little dry.  Flavor brings out a sweet maltiness.
",5
6987,"Pours dark with a hint of red color.  Small white head.  Yeasty nose. Tastes like caramel with hints of fruit.  Definite alcohol in the finish.
",5
6988,"330mL bottle from an in person trade. Pours a dark, murky brown, slight orange tinge to it making it appear copper toned when held to the light, with a smaller than expected white head. Aroma right away is what you would come to expect, yeasty wheaty maltyness, with the obligatory dark fruity aspects. Flowery and perfume-like, which is quite elegant and pleasant as it warms. Flavour is more of the same, with a decent thick feel to the body of this brew. Herbal-like hopping is present as well. Good sweet malts in the aftertaste. My only big problem with this is what I have with a lot of beers like it, in that I just dont really get much complexity from it. Its probably a pretty fresh bottle, and with plenty of age Im sure it could be something great. I just dont have the patience for such things. All in all a good one though. I meant to give it a higher rating but the numbers just dont seem to add up the way Id like them to. It does of course get much better as it warms.
",5
6989,"This is a VERY well made beer. I need to try it again because I was so caught off gaurd that I paid 9.50 for one 11.2oz bottle at the beer. Definitely a QUALITY beer.
",5
6990,"A great beer.  Very, very smooth and mild.  It was pretty malty and had a nice nut flavor.  There was a slightly vanilla aftertaste that I found appealing.  Attractive, a dark brown with a fluffy, beige head.  There was a fruity flavor that was a little hard to put my finger on, but I liked it.
",5
6991,"Pours an opaque brown, with a nice foamy tan head, speckles of sediment float in the glass. Aroma isnt really anything special. A little nutty, a little malty. Flavor hm. A bit of caramel flavor....around a roasty, nutty flavor. Flowing over my tongue, I also taste a bit of dark fruit....plum or grape. Overall, very good. I prefer the Rochefort 10 though.
",5
6992,"Pours an amber red with a nice head. Leaves some lacing on the glass. There is sediment that is floating in the glass. Smells like friut and vanilla. Tastes of fig, vanilla, and spice.
",1
6993,"Best if sipped on a cold winter night in the Champagne region of France. Even more special if the product was given to you by a Trappist monk with his blessing and the product was 19 years old and stll tasted great. Like a fine cognac!!!!
",5
6994,"Bottled. Dark brown beer with a big, light beige head. Complex aroma is a mixture of sweet fruits, spice, yeast and a hint of alcohol. I noticed at least bread, syrup, caramel, roastedness and some chocolate. Lovely vanilla notes too. A hint of alcohol in the finish. Flavor is syrupy sweet. Silky soft palate with hardly distinguishable alcohol in the finish. Amazingly easy to drink. One of the best beers that Ive had.
",5
6995,"This rating is based on a fresh 330ml bottle (but I prefer the 750ml bottle after 2-3 years storage, the difference is remarkable!) Dark brown body with a big, light brown head. Aroma is sweet, fruity and spicy. Flavor is complex, sweet malty, brown sugar, caramel, spices and a hint of chocolate, almost no hops. This beer is very balanced with a great, warming body. The alcohol is well hidden and almost only registered as a warm body.
",5
6996,"Botella comprada en supermercado. Color marron oscuro, espuma color crema. Aroma excelente. En boca se siente el alcohol, notas de frutas secas, amarga, todo junto. Muy buena.
",5
6997,"To me, this beer tasted like pitted fruit, which I like very much.  I enjoyed drinking this beer, but feel that I should try it again considering I tasted it at a beer festival and was not on my game at the point I got to Chimay.
",5
6998,"I couldve sworn Ive rated this beer here before. Oh well. 330 ml bottle. Dark brown color, tan head. Complex aroma of dark malts, stewed fruit and some alcohol. The flavor has amazing depth: sweet dark malts, raisings, chocolate, dark fruits, the works! High carbonation, medium-full body, well-balanced bitterness. Id love to get my hands on an older bottle.
",5
6999,"pours a hazy brown/red thick head. tons of caramel and dark fruit in the nose. taste is layered and very complex. rum soaked dark fruit, black cherry, brown sugar, candi sugar, and a slight but not overpowering bitterness. warm with a little kick from the alcohol. long, malty, slightly bitter finish.
",5
7000,"UPDATED: AUG 26, 2008 12oz bottle. pours very dark brown, nice airy head that dissipates quickly, but sticks around throughout. Most notable qualities of this beer are: constant carbonation and an alcohol presence throughout. Smells of dark fruits, tastes of dark fruits(specifically figs), brown sugar. Despite the alcoho presence, it doesnt detract from the flavor and enjoyment of the beer. Call me crazy, but this 9% tastes like a 5%, but feels more like 19% in my brain!		Definitely a fine brew...
",5
7001,"UPDATED: JUL 19, 2009 33cl, brew anno 2009, from De Hopduvel Gent, complex Trappist, balanced, cloudy, rocky head, very good brew

7002,"See the other few thousand positive comments! I cant believe how great a finish this beer has. Picked it up in Gubei Carrefour, Shanghai.
",5
7003,"75cl bottle @ home. Dark ruby/brown colour, creamy beige head. Aroma of dark fruit, yeast and chocolate, some alcohol. Flavours are dark fruits/raisins, caramel/brown sugar, bread. Lively carbonation, but still a soft mouthfeel. Too sweet imho, nevertheless enjoyable.
",5
7004,"Cloudy with an amber color and an almost constant stream of carbonation.  Its nutty caramel flavor gave way to fruity aftertastes.  I didnt think about the alcohol content until I started to get a little silly.  The flavor was masked by the exceptional flavor.  My dinner party beer of choice.
",5
7005,"This beer tastes completely traditional, from the nose to the finish, but it is all done in a greatly polished fashion. Tons of overripe dark fruits, and dark sugars of caramel and toffee. Nothing shockingly good, but it is an extremely pleasant ale to drink. With 2000 ratings, what more can I add to this discussion? A classic.
",5
7006,"750 mL bottle, dated 03/07.  Pours amber red with a large off-white head that quickly dissipates into a small but stable head.  Aroma is dark fruits, caramel sweetness, some tart apple, yeasty banana scents.  Flavor is dark fruits, caramel, a bit of banana.  Some mild hints of sweet and sour flavors.  Lively carbonation that complements the flavors well.  No lasting lacing.  I used to think I might not be a big fan of Belgian-style ales, but after Orval and this I guess I just wasnt trying the right ones!
",5
7007,"Iced coffee colored body with a light tan head that dissipated quickly. Faint nose of grass, yeast, and caramel. Nicely balanced taste that hid the above average alcohol content. I tasted hints of caramel and dark fruit. Nothing in the taste overpowered. Very nice beer.
",5
7008,"UPDATED: DEC 9, 2008 11.2 oz bottle Pours a darker brownish red with a medium sudsy creamy beige head that settles into something silky.  Aroma is faint, some nutty spice, dark fruit, sweet toffee malt.  Sweet dark fruit, slightly burnt malts, yeasty, a good amount of alcohol, light nuttiness, some bitterness as well.   Much richer fuller flavor than the rouge but still not unbelievable like I remember it.   The palate is also much better than the rouge, while still a little light, its airy, silky, but still has a nice consistency. 	7 4 8 4 15 		Grand Reserva Magnum 	wow... so much better and as complex as I remember it being years ago...	8 4 8 4 16
",5
7009,"A pleasant belgian ale with contemporary flavors, color, and palate. This is quite a good ale overall, but lacks anything new in character that cant be found elsewhere commonly. Still recommended.

7010,"Pours a muddy brown color with a beige head that has good retention. Forceful yeast aroma with some notes of grapes. Vinous flavor with dark molasses and prevalent yeast. Some dry fruitiness along the lines of figs. No alcohol taste whatsoever.
",5
7011,"One of the first Belgian Strong Ales I tried.  Lots of figs, raisins, citrusy fruits and brown sugar flavor.  Deep amber/brown color and bubbly white head.
",5
7012,"Awesome beer. had it with dinner tonight and i loved every second of it.  It was sweet in aroma and taste.  The was nice lastiung head and nice lacing.  Yeasty and smooth, a great beer.
",5
7013,"I thought this beer was quite good!! Color is a deep, deep red with a light tan head. Aroma is very low but a maltiness is noticable. Taste is huge and very long lasting. I notice nectarines (dark citrus), raisins, cherries, caramel, and a finish of slight alcohol and brandy. Alcohol in finish is more of a compliment than detriment. There were many very fine champagne-like bubbles (seemed high on carbonation but not uncomfortably high). Overall very lovely and quite tasty.
",5
7014,"pours a burnt amber color with a thin head that still yields nice lacing. A very pleasent and welcomed honey almond aroma. The flavor is extrmely deep, hints of fruits raisins nuts and a well hidden alcohol. the mouthfeel is nigh majestic. Nice carbonation and coats the mouth well with a long aftertaste. This is one of the better beers i have tasted.
",5
7015,"Pours a rich, reddish ochre, with a faint nose of yeast, malt, and honeyed-fruit,  though with a quickly disappearing head. Full on the palate, very pleasant blend, and making up on the palate for what it lacks elsewhere, thereby delivering a memorable beer.
",5
7016,"Bottle from Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville. Dark brown pour with a thin head. Aroma of chocolate, green apple and vinegar. Rich malty, fruity taste with hints of chocolate and toffee. Full bodied with alcohol nicely hidden.
",5
7017,"Bottle courtesy of chadspivey.  Thanks for sharing this huge 1.5 L bottle!		Pours a rich reddish caramel color with a small beige head.  Smell is caramel, and fruitiness in the way of strawberries.  Taste is fruity, sweet caramelized raisin, red fruits (strawberry) and a fizzy body with medium thickness.  Nice flavor overall, and very pleasant and bubbly.  Solid beer.
",5
7018,"Bottle. Pours a deep cloudy brown with a firm beautiful beige head. Sweet aroma. Taste is sweet of plums and toffee, with a touch of roasted malt in there- finish is faintly bitter and dry. 9%???!!! cant smell or taste it, amazing. My favorite chimay.
",5
7019,"Definitely one sexy looking beer.  Intense all the way through, with a hint of the alcohol showing through.  Flavor comes back nicely when you burp, but this is one beer you dont mind repeating.
",5
7020,"Ever since the Rohefort 6 Ive been in love with Trappist beer.  This weekend Im finally going to Illinois ot pick up the Rochefort 10 but I figured that the Chimay would tie me over until the weekend.  Full and beautiful as only a trappist can be with hints of chocolate and toffee in every sip.  The aroma is less fruity than an Aventinus and all delicious beer.  This one really surprised me.
",5
7021,"Bottle. Pours dark brown with some off-white head. Quite alcoholic and thinner, for lack of a better work, than some comparable brews. This is not necessarily bad. I liked it and will have it again.
",5
7022,"Bottle Pours out a cloudy brown with some red topped with a off white head. Aroma of pit fruit and malts. Tast more of the fruit some yeast and roast malts.
",5
7023,"A very niece, warming Belgian strong ale. The flavor starts with a bit of alcohol and roasted malts and ends to warming feel of alcohol and winegrapes.
",5
7024,"(Deleted and re-rated). 750ml corked bottle, 2007. Pops explosively open with a waft of black cherry fruit, blood, apple yeastiness, a sniff of roasted malt, raisin, ALCOHOL. A promising start. Forms a gushing tan head in the bottle but dies instantly in the glass. The thinness and booze-drenched finesse of McChouffe or Kasteel Bruin, minus a few tablespoons of sugar. Way too much marzipan (alcohol) for me, with no depth of character to back it up. Totally embarassed by its Trappist brothers (Westmalle Dubbel, Westies, Rocheforts). This is more a watery Scotch ale or barley wine than it is a fat, hallucinatory monastic bruiser. Seriously disappointing, and not for the first time. I could brew better in my shed.                                       	(original rate)...Porterish black-brown topped with a creamy beige. Sillky mouthfeel. Apple and caramel opening up in the nose as it warms. But an oddly underwhelming and flavourless ale for the ABV. Dour and sugary with an unsubtle waft of spiritous booze and a fairly caustic bitterness in the finish. No spice, no roastiness, certainly no hops (extract). Anonymous milky maltiness that looks, smells and feels far more interesting than it tastes (6/4/4/4/11/2.9)
",1
7025,"pours dark amber/brown with a large sustaining tan head.  aroma is fruity, molasses, maple syrup.  flavor is much of the same, plum, raisin, alcohol.  highly carbonated, light body.  alcohol is very noticable and warm going down.
",5
7026,"Bottle,  Large white head.  Hazy brown body.  Light plum/prune/cherry flavor.  Medium body with average carbonation.  Lightly acidic.  Muted but pretty good.  Rockfort 8 is a little better.
",5
7027,"Finally tried this one and it did not disappoint.  Fabulous darkfruit aroma with some roasty malt and a touch of yeast.  Very sweet and silky smooth on the tongue.  Aftertaste is nothing but pleasant and warming.  Ill definitely get this again.
",5
7028,"UPDATED: JUL 9, 2008 Absolutely zero head on this baby.  Another much-maligned readily available belgian beer that has suffered due to its popularity.  Not being a prima donna, Im gonna say that this is a great beer.  An interesting literal and metaphorical tongue sizzle from beginning to end.  Appreciating a good beer is like making love to a beautiful woman...no two muffs are alike and sometimes im inclined to something a little rough around the edges (i am an AvidDirtman after all).		Im fascinated by the different colours in the glass.  The outer rim seems light brown fading into a hazelnut utopia. The nose is a mixed bag of nuts and it has a malty, milk chocolate palatte.  Yeah weve all drank westveleteren (and i have - tis an amazing brew) but this is still perfectly drinkable beer that would still be held in high regard if it werent for some other indescribable beauties out there.
",5
7029,"One of my favorites. Very nice dark color with a decent head. Gets better every taste. Especially the last part of the glass is fantastic. Its not too sweet, not to bitter, not too fruity. Just a perfect strong ale with just the right amount of alcohol.
",5
7030,"Pours very dark with nice head and lacing. Aroma is of yeast, caramel, and fruitiness. Taste is similar to port but a dancing foam on the palate. Caramelly with a bit of alcohol. Fantastic with desert.
",5
7031,"UPDATED: JAN 7, 2009 Darker pour than the other Chimays, had this on bottle at St. Tropez in Philadelphia. Overall a good beer, but I found it a bit overrated. Preferred the Rouge.
",5
7032,"Bottle. Chimay Bleue pours a nice thick white head almost as beautiful as Duvel ,but only makes it to the neck of a tulip glass. Lacing is present but doesnt stick to the glass very well. Color is dark brown. From three feet away you can catch the bread aroma of this brew. When you get your nose into it, you also pick up notes of citrus, some fruit possibly grapes, and some malt. Bleue has some very sweet flavors of fruit, caramel malts, a hint of alcohol, and some bitterness in the finish.
",5
7033,"UPDATED: NOV 20, 2008 0.33l bottle few occasions		Pours a deep, dark muddy brown with an beige dissapearing ,head. 		Smell if fruity, malty, yeast and some alcohol, flavour is much the same, quite sweet, lots of yeast, bread, fruit, cherry and peach, and some alcohol but well hidden. Enjoyable and very easy to find which is a bonus.
",5
7034,"I liked it a good deal, but I prefer the Red and White Chimays more. This one just didnt have the flavors and aroma that the other two (especially the white) had.
",5
7035,"Kept this 22oz bottle in my closet for the past few months, hardly cellar conditions, but out of the sunlight. Starts off with a nice thick, almost white head. The beer appears almost black in a low-lit room, but held to the light it demonstrates a ruby red colour. The head settles down to a thin, but steady, layer and leaves nice lacing. The aroma is malty and mellow, but with a slightly sharp hint. Hits the lips like velvet. Smooth texture with a malty, only slightly bitter taste that ends with a hit of alcohol. I expected that this would go a bit skunky in the closet, considering the conditions, but it turned out to be a great, late night bev. Il have to try a brand new bottle for comparison.
",5
7036,"Pop top bottle.  Fairly strong aroma, bready malt and belgian yeast as expected, some alcohol, raisins/grapes,  with a minor light citrus fruit.  Very murky, grey sediment mixed in with the grayish-light brown color, pour had decent pillowy head, dissipated eventually, little lacing that doesnt stick.   Similar to the chimay red with that slight roasty bite to it that lingers into the finish in the back of the throat, very evident yeast flavor with darker sweet dough malt, also almost like a dark berry fruit, little bitter fades into the aftertaste quickly.  Love the complexity, the better the less cold it got, if not for the finish would be even more outstanding.
",5
7037,"POurs a nice brown color with a small off white head. Aroma is of dark fruits like dates and plums and very malty. Flavor is also of dark fruits with sweet candy sugar.
",5
7038,"UPDATED: JUL 30, 2008 as soon as teh bottle top is popped off you know this is something special; a real profusion of summer fruits, berries, caramels and other things that I am yet to work out. then it pours a dispersed sunset of graded colours; port red, brown and orange with a dark cream head. flavours are complex and shifting with a balanced, medium sweetness.

7040,"Healthy, lively head that produces some wonderful lacing in the glass. Fruit, caramel and toffee in the aroma.  As it warms, the flavours change and meld into an unusual level of complexity upon the tongue.  Definately, drink this one at room temperature.  A classic.

7042,"copper-brown in color, somewhat hazy, head retention is less than optimal for style.  aroma is complex and malty, but somewhat weak.  definitely some alcohol warmth in the flavor, but that is to be expected.  high carbonation, little to no aftertaste.
",5
7043,"Poured a dark brown with a creamy thin off-white head. Smelled of yeast and fruit. The body was very powerfull and complex. There were aspects of yeast flavors, fruitiness, and a sweet caramel backbone. Also, I detected a more than subtle hint of raisin in the aftertaste. Truly an experience to remember. My hats off to the monks that make this extraordinary beer.
",5
7044,"This was a strong beer, but the complex flavour compared to most beers makes it quite unique and delicious.
",5
7045,"Grande Reserve, pours a rich dark brown color with an off-white head. Flavor of sweet caramel, Belgian yeast, and dark fruits. Very smooth, especially for the alcohol content. A great beer, the best Chimay has to offer in my opinion.
",5
7046,"Bottle pours a rich, dark brown color with a thin tan head.  Aroma of yeast, dried fruits, and burnt sugar.  Flavor is slightly sweet, roasted malts, and dried fruits.  Alcohol presence is noticeable, but not too strong.  Great aftertaste that lingers for a while.
",5
7047,"UPDATED: MAR 15, 2009 33 cl bottle - Dark brown unclear beer with a nice head. Aroma is filled with fruits, dried fruits, prunes and yeast. The beer has a widely ranged, heavy flavor, with a fullness thats hard to beat. Flavors include Chocolate, sweet dried fruits, toffee and spices. Goes extremely well with the strongest of food flavors. Nice and rugged bitterness makes for a good late feel. 		75 cl Grand Reserve 2001 - Aroma is malty and slightly vinous with hints of cork(?), ripe fruits and nuts. Flavor is also vinous with notes of yeast, raisins and lots of fruits! Very nice beer, the beer has really softened through the years and become very vinous, though not in a negative sense.

7048,"11.2 oz. bottle.  Pours a dark brown/tan with a foamy off-white head.  Very malty, with mild hops.
",5
7049,"Small bottle from Press Club in Portland, OR--Poured a dark brown-aubergine body with a one finger white fluffy head that quickly dissipated.  Malty, spicy nose.  Rich, nutty, molasses, toffee, saccharine notes.  This is one of the all time greats!

7050,"75cl bottle from Willow Bend Liquors (Tampa). Pours a dark brown with one finger white head the fades quickly but still laces the glass. Smells sweet, earthy and sugary with notes of earthiness and molasses. Taste is sweet and malty with hints of spice, molasses, and candy sugar. Rich, full-bodied ale with a smooth, lingering, malty, sugary finish.
",5
7051,"Bottle.  Pours a dark brown body with a tan head 4 fingers high. Aroma is sweet malt, some belgian spices, and abv in the nose.  Flavor is that.  Not my favorite of the trappist ales  but a solid choice and my favorite from chimay.  You cant go wrong with this brew.

7052,"33CL bottle, strong beer. Great head. Nice deep red color. Another good Chimay beer. Dark fruity taste.

7053,"Clovey sweet and cola spicy nose.  Cloudy amber/brown color, some hints of red, nice frothy long-lasting head.  Malty caramel sweetness, raisins and light toasted white bread.  Easy bitterness and some tartness, provides a fantastic balance.  Mouth feel is full and carbonation is creamy and silky.

",5
7054,"UPDATED: NOV 14, 2010 Pours a deep red with a nice white head.  Lots of bread, malt, dark fruit and yeast flavors.  This was, long ago, one of my real initiations into Belgian beers and still quite wonderful.

7055,"Pours opaque brown with a tan head. The head lasts for a while. Aroma had a floral sweet spice smell that I could not place. The flavor is very complex. Malt, yeast and dark fruit present in the taste.Definitely tasted better as it warmed.

",5
7057,"25oz bottle.  pleasantly yeasty aroma, much like the commercial description insists.  Distinctly Belgian flavor, fruity and soft with only a hint of the hidden alcohol that persists within.  Its pretty, too. And itll knock you to the ground.

7058,"UPDATED: DEC 21, 2008 Dark fruits, malts, sugar, alcohol and yeast in aroma. Flavor is sweet malts, dark fruits, candi sugar and toffee, some alcohol and hops. Alcohol warms nicely. Very smooth palate and easy to drink.

7061,"When asked for a recommendation at ""The Kulminato"" in Antwerp, this is what Dirks companion told as that you could never go wrong with. I drank a 2004 4 year old bottle last night. Perfect flavors of a rich, belgian ale with a smooth aftertaste. Perfect on the palate, without a strong alcohol taste for being 9%!
",5
7062,"Sampled often.  Dark burnt caramel pour with a towering eggshell head that leaves significant lacing inside of the glass.  Definitely on a Belgian kick.  Fruity nose with some yeasty/peppery qualities.  Brown sugar, plum, raisin, toffee, and spicy with the ABV masked beautifully.  Medium mouthfeel.  Yum.
",5
7063,"Bottle from Csak a j sr. Poured murky, deep-brown and massive, firm, beige foam. Not very complex, light hints of caramel and flowers in the nose. Aroma of plum, raisins and cocoa. Sweet, but not too much, well balanced with a discreet hoppyness in the finish, which is then settled with a sweet aftertaste that lasts. Alcohol is well hidden. Everything is in order, even if it could use more complexity.
",5
7064,"A very nice beer with a smell of some spices and possibly some yeast. A fine dark colour with a beige head. Good taste with some karamell in it. Light bitterness and maybe some fruit in taste. You do feel some of the high ABV in the taste.

",5
7067,"Wish I could try one that had been stored for 5-10 years as someone wrote... As it stands, and based on a fresh batch, this is still a bloody good beer. Pours medium brown with a big tan head. Aroma is sweet caramel and wheat malts, belgian yeast, brown sugar, dark dried fruits (raisins, figs etc). Definitely some spices in there as well, of course. Taste is similarly sweet yet balanced, with lots of malts and yeast dominating but the hops balancing the whole thing up. Body is medium - actually kind of light but definitely not in a bad way - with a perfect amount of carbonation.
",5
7068,"caramel, cereal, coffee, coffee brown, full body, 	Bottled. A must. It smells and tastes torrefaction with a really good  dosage. The ratio quality/availability is the better

7070,"75 Cl. bottle. Aside from the massive amount of of foam released upon opening this beer (due to my own mishandling) this beer was a serious treat. Though not as strong as I would have liked (compared to its Trappist counterparts) this beer demonstrates a great, balanced flavor and a smooth finish.
",5
7071,"This is a phenomenal beer. Had it dozens of times. It pours a great dark brown color with a  nice thick head. The aroma is sweet and fruity and the palette is nice and smooth. The taste is very warming this is one of those beers that just makes you feel good to drink it. A must try for any beer fan.
",5
7072,"This is my favorite Chimay.  Ive had it only twice - the first time in a big, corked bottle, the second time at the Bentwood Tavern in New Buffalo, MI.  I swear the stuff out of the big bottle poured darker and had a rockier head, with lots of lacing down the side of the glass.  The smaller bottle was poured into the glass so as not to have a head.  Dude even rolled the bottle on the table before popping the cap.  Brown in color, yeasty in aroma, some sweetness and caramel in the flavor.
",5
7073,"The beer pours a deep brown color. The head hangs around awhile. The flavor is very complex, I think I tasted some chocolate flavors or licorice. Definitely tasted better as it warmed. I recommend.
",5
7074,"UPDATED: AUG 28, 2008 Deep ruby brown color. Head is beige and creamy. Very fruity aroma is sweet, raisiny, malty and yeasty. Flavor is fruity, sugary malty, yeasty and raisiny. Quite full-bodied, smoothly and foamy carbonated and alcoholic palate.

7075,"330 ml bottle. dark amber, brown colour. taste is spicy, full of flavours. an other great Belgian strong ale.
",5
7076,"The basically tastes like Chimay red but with a little more floral and spice character.  Pour is dark hazy brown with fluffy white head.  Aroma is of fruit, raisins, heavy belgian spice, and is also sweet.  Flavor is again sweet and malty finishing with a slight raisin quality.  Good brew.  May buy again.

7077,"Absolutely amazing beer. This is a must try for anyone who appreciates good beer. Pure magic!

7078,"pure brilliance- pours cola rootbeer brown cloudy with brilliant frizzy tightknit head. nose is liquorice, slight chocolate, yeasty bread, caramel, and belgian sugars. taste is just as complex. a great beer. classic stuff.
",5
7079,"pours an amber color.  floral scent with belgian yeast and carmel.  taste is the same with some roast as well.  Alcohol is well hidden as well.  I would purchase again.
",5
7080,"Poured from 750ml bottle a burnt red-brown with large creamy tan head and lots of carbonation bubbling.  Aromas of dark fruit, yeast, brown sugar, and light banana.  Flavor pours in when this beer hits the right temperature.  Brown sugar, raisin, fig, plum, banana, wheat, malt, yeast, an acidic spiciness, and a bit of dough.  The finish is warm with alcohol.  The alcohol is overwhelming when the beer is colder, but nice when the beer warms.  Overall, a top of the line beer, easy to find, and one Il drink anytime.
",5
7081,"The beer pours a deep amber with an off white head that is made up of tiny bubbles and is mostly lasting, the beer is full of tiny pieces of sediment. The nose is deep and a mix of fresh bread, roasted malt, slight hops, orange, lemon, stone fruit, spices, coriander, and cinnamon. The beer fills your mouth with carbonation and a light airiness. The front of the taste is a mix of sharp alcohol and sweet malts, the sides of the tongue really pick up the citrus notes and the back is a well balanced mix of malts and spice. The finish is sweet malts with fresh yeast and is mostly lasting.
",5
7082,"I remember distinctly that I liked this beer but liked the tripel much better.  Aroma was of dark fruits and pretty heavy on the alky-hol.  Dry finish.  Will taste again.

",5
7084,"Bottle from BevMo in Vacaville, CA. Poured a reddish brown with a brown head. Like many other Belgian Strong Ales it smelled of dark fruits and just a hint of floral scents. Tasted of dried fruit, carmel and roasted malts. Hit the palate just right. WOW!!
",5
7085,"Sweet Mary this is good.		Very  complex, but worth it.  Pours a red/brown with a floral, citrus, dark fruit, roasted malty hoppy aroma.  The flavor is much like the aroma and is accented by plenty of carbonation...high in ABV, but the alcohol taste isnt overly apparent.		Terrific.
",5
7086,"(Bottle 750 ml, Grande Rserve 2001, aged 7 years) Dark reddish brown colour with brief, frothy beige head. Spicy, earthy nose with notes of cellar, liquorice, dried fruit and black-currant. Malty, fruity, spicy taste with dried fruit, liquorice, hints of ginger, black-currant, chocolate and a spicy, fiery finish. Slightly earthy, but less cellar and more dark fruit in the flavours than in the aroma. Slightly above medium body, sweet but never cloying. Very nice, truly a classic.
",5
7087,"This was the beer that got me into good beer. I cant really describe the flavor, but I know that I like it. Unlike a lot of high alcohol beers, it isnt overly sweet.
",5
7088,"UPDATED: SEP 12, 2008 11.2 oz. bottle pours reddish brown with little cream head. Strong aroma of alcohol and grapes. Taste is some citrius and malt clean finish. Does not taste like a 9% ABV beer. Very nice.
",5
7089,"4/24/08 notes:  Bomber, split with friend.  Finally I get a chance to try Chimay!  Pours an attractive ruby brown that is cloudy.  Aroma is of malts and spices, a wonderful blend that I cannot do justice to by description.  Features an smooth flavor of soft malts, brown sugar, caramel, roasts, wood and alcohol.  There must also be some fruit notes in there, because this beer is rich and complex, without sacrificing perfect crisp drinkability.  The soft carbonation brings out the flavors.  Of the BSAs Ive tried, this tops the list.
",5
7090,"[330ml bottle from Waitrose, Marlow] Bottle fizzed up a little on opening, disturbing the yeast and releasing huge dark fruit aromas. Deep red colour. Taste initially strong malt and rich fruit, then a hint of coffee, chocolate and treacle, then a bit of iron which combined with the malt made it taste briefly like a health drink.  Too many floaters by the end to finish it. Aftertaste initially pleasantly malty, but with a sickly syrupy-sweet mouth coasting.  After a while fades to leave sourness.  Pleasant but disappointing - I actually thought that the Chimay Red was a far better balanced beer.
",5
7091,"750 mL bottle.  Pours a light brown with a nice white foamy head.  Aroma and flavor are both sweet with the distinctive banana/cloves undertones that you expect out of this style.  Very tasty, and strong too, but you couldnt tell it from them taste.
",5
7092,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2010 Lighter than expected. Dark with a nicely persistent foam but likely that goes down to a good level. Fruity, thick and a bit citrusy. Rather balanced.Good complexity but somewhat short and leaving me wanting for more.
",5
7093,"330 ml.  Finally I have gotten around to Chimay.  All that is needed to say, is that after countless very good Belgian beers, this beer is still striking.  Pours dark brown with porous white head.  Nose is a like a bowl of fruit with syrup poured over it that subdues the aroma but intensifies it in some aspects.  Body is lively with the same bowl of fruit.  This is like a refreshing dessert in summertime.  Contains nothing that people sometimes dislike about beer.  Possibly underrated.  A great beer.
",5
7094,"bottle.  pours a cloudy (nearly opaque) dark brown, with a huge cream head.  rather standard belgian strong dark smell, with that dark caramel malt and tons of dark fruity esters:  raisins, figs, grapes, pears, and a bit of spicy bread.  but it also seemed to tend toward a kind of dark malt flavor, with some chocolatiness.  very much the same notes in the taste, but the grape esters stood out a bit more, as did the malt flavor, which surprised me in how like dark malt it was.  rather caramelly, but still a bit chocolaty.  pretty sweet in the finish, with a very light bitter just to keep the sweetness from taking over and becoming cloying.  thick, chewy, creamy mouthfeel, and pretty full of body.  lots of carbonation.  very solid like any other trappist ive had.  it has its own identity, and just the level of complexity id expect from a trappist brewery.  in short, very, very good.
",5
7095,"Dark brown colour.Thick and lasting creamy head. Notes of raisin, dark fruits and malts. Carabonation is sprinkly. Good full body. Complex Belgium. Long end.
",5
7096,"Bottle. Aroma is really fruity with some spicy and fiery notes. Taste is full of raisans,caramel and other fruits. Aftertaste is a bit alcohol dominated and gives you a warm and nice finish.

7097,"Pours an opaque dark brown.  One-finger off-white head that dissipates fairly quickly.  Complex aroma, with yeast and lots of fruit (tart cherry leading the way).  I agree with the rater below that the flavor doesnt quite live up to the aroma, but is still complex and good in its own right.  Sweet caramel malt flavors and dark fruits.  Medium bodied and a smooth drink, but that alcohol definitely gets you in the aftertaste and gives you a warm, flushed feeling.  Its a good beer, yes, but there are better ones of this style out there.

7098,"Bottle. Pours a cloudy dark brown with a medium off white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is dark fruit, yeast, sweet malt, alcohol - delicious. Taste is dark fruit, sweet bready malt, finish of semi-sweet dark fruit lingers on the back of the tongue. Palate is moderately carbonated. Definite alcohol presence.

7099,"330 ml bottle from a trade with hogtownharry. thx harry ive wanted this one for a long time. pours beautiful dark brown with a big tan head. just the way youd expect a big dark belgian to look. aromas are amazingly complex. sweetness, yeast, dark fruit medly, rich maltiness. yum. the flavour cant quite live up to the aroma but is still amazing. a very enjoyable brew. thanks again harry.

7100,"Pours sediment rich, dark brown color - opaque even when held to the light. Nice, frothy beige head that dissapates moderatly fast, Aroma of bananas. Nice mouthfeel - full, rich and bubbly, leaves a nice alcohol warmness in the back of the throat. Theres almost an astringent quality, my tongue sizzles from the carbonation, similar to drinking mineral water. I really like that. The flavor is pleasing. Malty, a bit fruity but not dominated by citrus, as many other brews are. Good stuff!
",5
7101,"UPDATED: JUL 29, 2008 I am relatively new to craft beer, with that being said I have to say that this is the best beer I have ever tasted.  I didnt really know what to expect at first and I was originally going to age the bottle I had.  I decided to try it out, and I am so glad I did.
",5
7102,"330 ml bottle. Medium brown, slightly reddish, with small flakes of yeast and a creamy, thin, lasting head. Aroma is plumbs, raisins, yeast and some alcohol. Flavour is strong and full, sweet malts, fruits and caramel. Long warm aftertaste.
",5
7103,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2008 Apperance: Pours a clearish, reddish-brown body marked by a few yeast floaties and topped by a huge, foamy, off-white head.		Smell: Dark caramel scent seasoned with sugar and a savor yeastiness. Sharp fruitiness, with cherry definitely leading the way. Slight wafty hints at that 9% ABV.		Taste: Sweetish maltiness with flavors of dark caramel compounded by a spicy dark candi sugar taste. Hint of breadcrusts. Growing plum and black cherry fruitiness. Spoonful of simple syrup. Slight savory yeastiness. Spice and a medium bitterness try to bring a bit of balance. Drying, cherry-packed finish.		Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Moderate carbonation.		Drinkability: All kinds of decent, but, and this is between you and me, I more of a Rochefort man, myself.

7104,"I was impressed with this Belgian Strong Ale.  I bought the larger bottle, cork was stamped 01/08 so it was a new vintage.  It poured a very dark tan with a light tan, fairly large head.  The head stayed through out the drink.  Palate was nice, slightly creamy, little bubbly.  Flavor was slightly sweet, with nice roast malt flavor.  You could smell the yeast - smelt like bread dough really.  Good beer - one of the best, in my top 10.

7105,"750ml bottle. dark brown murkey pour. thin creamy head, does not last long. smooth yeast flavor with distinct floral taste. alcohol is very well hidden. one of the better bers outh there. slight bitterness and sweetness. class of its own

7106,"Full of flavors and very drinkable.  Be careful when drinking this one.  A masterpiece of a brew.

7107,"(BELGIUM) Had this one at the Capts house, Thanks guys!!!  WOW, I was told by AFI96 that this one would be the best. It has a brown / burgundy color with a nice foamy white head. The flavor has a pleasant fizzy vanilla / cookie taste. Its a full bodied brew that goes down quickly. Do yourself a favor, go get some !!!
",5
7108,"From a 750 ml corked bottle.  A murky purplish-brown color with a fizzy champagne like head that dissipated within seconds after pouring.  Fizzy champagne like carbonation too.  Nose of plumbs, prunes, and some floral notes.  Fizzy, like champagne, on the palate.  Plum and prune in the taste.  With the prune like taste and the fizzy carbonation, I could not help thinking of ""Dr. Pepper"" (the soft drink) as I was drinking it.  I cant decide if thats good or bad.  A decidedly noticeable alcohol taste too, and an alcohol finish.
",5
7109,"22oz caged bomber. Pours an awesome reddish brown with a big fizzy off white head that dissipates quickly. Huge aromas of figs, raisins a great smelling yeast and a touch of alchohol. Taste opens up with raisins, ends with a little hoppiness for balance and a big yeasty malty note filled with cherries and vanilla. The super long and dry finish lingers forever with notes of chocolate and vanilla. The best of the Chimays.
",5
7110,"Thanks for sharing afire.  Large Blue- Nice hazy nut brown pour with really pleasant foam head.  Yeast flora aroma. Great carbonation.  For me the best so far of the Chimays, although the alc. was higher than all the others very un-intrusive.  Smooth and even body Belgian strong with a touch of sweetness.  Just great all around.
",5
7111,"Pours dark, dark brown and murky with a modest off white head.  Yeasty aroma - similar to the Red.  Banana, sweet syrup, roasted malt.  Full bodied.  Mild, but long finish.  Easily paired with a Punch, Cohiba, or other spicy cigar - or food, if youre into that.
",5
7112,"Weak date and yeast aroma. Brown color, thin head, full of sediment. Phenolic flavor of dates. Caramel appears during warming. Decent hop finish. Harsh mouthfeel, underachieving sample of a trappist ale. What a drag.

7113,"75CL bottle into Chimay branded Trappist glass.  Pours about as beuatifully as a beer can: a ruby-plum-chocolate color with a robust dusty head.  Aroma is a heavenly mixture of fruitiness, malts and a little alcohol zing.  Flavor evolves throughout the drinking experience, but is always a rich malted sweet, both fruity and full on the tongue.  The feeling left behind in the mouth is as satisfying as everything else.  This beer is drinkable, hearty, explosive with flavor and warmth.  I always have a bottle around for when that moment happens that calls for an indulgence.  Superb.

7114,"Brown colored with a big foamy nice head.  Smells are sweet, spiced, fruity, some alcohol.  Taste is sweet, malty, alcohol, and complex.  Good beer.
",5
7115,"This is truly a beautiful beer, with a powerful malt background.  Seriously this is like a fine wine and can be aged as such, and as amazing complexity.  With a flavor that evolves from one sip to the next, a cookie dough maltiness, with an amazing mouithfeel.  Sweet toffee and coffee flavorsm, and a subtle candi sugar fruitiness.  This is truly a lovely beer.
",5
7116,"Pours beautiful hazy plum with frothy two finger head. Nose of sweet malt and dark fruit. Flavors are incredible- lingering sweetness from residual sugar, powerful malt, and excellently masked alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth, rich, chewy, and lingering. Simply incredible- this is hard to beat.
",5
7117,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2011 courtesy of oteyj. pours a dark walnut color with a steady, slow to die head, really persistent carbonation. aroma has a lot of dark fruit, grape, sweetness. flavor is incredible- very sweet, but the complexity is so subtle that it remains so smooth. delicious aftertaste makes you want to take the next sip so the taste never leaves your tongue.
",5
7118,"Pours brown with light tan head. Aromas of dough, bread and brown sugar. Flavors are sweet and fruity, with yeast and some dark malts. Medium to full body with tingly carbonationand a slick mouthfeel. Very nice.
",5
7119,"UPDATED: JUN 13, 2008 11.20 bottle: Yes another beautiful from Chimay.  Dark brown color with an off white/tan head.  I used to think this was the best but now I think I prefer the Red over this one.  Both are great beers but just the hint of hops in the Red make it more complex.  This beer also has a wonderful rich taste consisting of sweet dark malt with a syrup-esque feel and a hint of bubble gum.  It also has an aftertaste to go along with it, but the Reds aftertaste is more poignant.  Nevertheless I love Chimay.
",5
7120,"Bottle, served at cellar temperature...  Poured deep, foggy ruby with a beige head that formed massive and quickly.  Aroma of thick malt and lurking alcohol.  Big sizzle on the tongue with a nice sting.  Flavors of big malt and brown sugar and other fruity flavors like apples.  Finished with a wine-like aftertaste.
",5
7121,"Pours a light cola brown with little head. Initial aroma of apples and cloves, moving into dark cherries and yeast. Very high carbonation, much like Piraat it drinks like a champagne. Flavor makes those apples and cloves turn darker, moving toward raisins and malts and intensifying the cherries. A good solid complex Belgian, but nothing to write home about - it doesnt pack the punch I like in a strong Belgian.
",5
7122,"Nice belgain strong ale.....my second least fav of the style but that being said.....still a solid beer...has the yeast character that I find with all of the chimay beers...that I dont like...but everyone else seems to love......good complex malt flavor.......tons of esters	only if people would serve this at correct temp!
",5
7123,"Ok, I love trappist beers and this is one of the better ones. Its great because it has wonderful flavor and it is not as expensive as the other Trappists. Very complex flavor. Great color, smell, everything about this beer is great!

7124,"The appearance was fooling.  Enjoyed this flavorful beer.  Plan to buy again.

7125,"750mL Magnum poured into a snifter.  Pours dark brown, cloudy, with a large beige head that fades pretty fast.  Aroma is very belgian.  It smells malty and yeasty with an earthy quality.  Theres just a hint of alcohol in the background.  Take a sip and its very creamy, but not too thick.  Flavor is very much like a red wine or even a port.  Theres a touch of alcohol warmness, but its held nicely in place by the incredible sweetness of this brew.  It finishes quite dry and leaves a nice aftertaste of sweet grapes and raisins.  Very good beer.

7128,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2010 Re-rate 10/8/2010.  Murky brown color with a thin frothy head settling on top.  Plums, brown sugar, Belgian yeasty notes, molasses.  Not quite as rich as I remember but pretty good stuff regardless.  Original rating:  Deep hazy brown color topped with a nice thick tan head. Malty aroma with a spicy dark fruit character. A nice rich bold flavor that combines slightly sweet fruits, yeast, and brown sugary notes. A smooth full-bodied texture. A slight tart presence. I now have had the Red, White and Blue and while Id give the Blue and White the edge over the Red but they all solid.

7129,"UPDATED: APR 11, 2008 11.2 ounce bottle-  now I know why monks are so happy!  This ale poured a dark golden brown, with the appropriate cloudiness.  Aroma was thick malt.  Head was perfect, foamy and lasted the full glass.  That really wasnt very long with this wonderful ale.  Savoring this brew was like postponing orgasm, a theory at best.  It is a good thing that this beer is fairly pricey, lest the Fat Man become addicted.  Get some, now.
",5
7130,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2008 33cl bottle from Vinmonopolet. It poured a dark red brown, almost black colour with very big off-white head that settles down fast in the glass. The aroma is a bit sweet and smells of raisins, alcohol and fruits. It has a bitter flavour that tastes of malts, raisins and alcohol. It has a short aftertaste.

7131,"2007 Bottle. Pours red-brown with chunks of yeast. Small aroma of fresh and dried fruits, dates, figs, ananas, strawberries. Very soft and creamy. Thin body with big frothy carbonation. Quite dry, but still with a sweet taste due to low hopping. Slightly bitter finish from the yeast and rosted malt. Phenolic, soft and fruity. Dates and rye spicyness. Alcoholic.
",5
7132,"A little less flavor then I expected, but for a 9% ale the alcohol wasnt overpowering. Poured great with a fab head worthy of sticking your nose into... but after several sips I felt compelled to wear a robe, quote a psalm,  and stay slient through the remainder of the meal. Darn those Trappists!!!! A nice treat, but not my personal choice for the day in, day out.

7133,"Although I do think that this beer is a good beer, I dont see how this is in the 99 percentile. I didnt think that it had the flavor or stood out enough in my mind to be this high up in the ratings.	I do like the color and flavor but it just lacks the oomph of what I would consider a 99 percentile beer.
",5
7134,"A dark brown cloudy beer, pops off with so much foam out of the bottle that it runs all over the place. Then it settles down quickly and has no head at all. No lacing. Aroma of malt, thyme, dark sugars, and yeast. Flavor is dark malt, corriander, citrus, and is exceptionally smooth for the style. Strong flat malt aftertaste.

7135,"I still havent tasted anything better than this. Killer aroma. Nice foamy top.
",5
7136,"0.3l bottle.very strong. to be sipped slowly.	too much carbonation for me.	gets more pleasent when left warm a bt and less carbonation.	Dont understand the ""superbeer"" classification.
",5
7137,"Chimay Blue was one of my first tastes of what the Belgium Trappist beers have to offer. One of the most important rules for drinking this beer is to drink it out of proper glassware. It really releases the full flavor which is what its all about. Great beer when you want to sit back and enjoy some of the finer things in life.
",5
7138,"Mildly sweet aroma but not alarmingly sweet like many strong ales. Beatiful swirling hypnotizing pour in a darker brown liquid. Decent fizz on the palate. Alky shows thru on the tongue at times. I guess I am a little crestfallen considering the percentile of this brew. Chimay white was much more enjoyable than this, but what should I expect for a strong ale.  Strong ales are not one of my favorites. I just thought that it would be a little more refined than the typical american wanna bee belgie strong ale. Not what I expected. Reminds me of the letdown when, in eager anticipation from the raters on this site, that I tasted my first highly rated imperial stout. Finish is not long lingering but it is a little alky bitter.

7139,"aroma of dark fruits and yeast... rich smooth malt flavor.  not my absolute favorite of the trappist ales but excellent nonetheless

7140,"Bottle, 750 ml.  An amazing beer.  Having first loved the red, as this is my brothers favorite, I now insist he gets me a blue label when buying Chimay!  I was impressed to find it at the only bar in the Manchester, NH air port.

7141,"UPDATED: AUG 23, 2009 Dark murky brown, thin head. Strong malty aroma. Very carbonated (overcarbonated even). Tasty dark malts - plums, raisins. Alcohol is fairly well hidden. Yeasty. Slight impression of roasted nuts.

7142,"Bottle.  Poured a dark brown with a 1 cm light tan head that persisted.  Aroma and taste of dark fruits (raisin, prune, fig) and Belgian yeast.  Some bitterness.  A well-balanced beer.  Excellent!
